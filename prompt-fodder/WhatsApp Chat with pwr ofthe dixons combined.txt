We thought it was because it was Thanksgiving but it was also pouring rain that day and that May have been the actual reason. Park is packed today with long wait times but we are still having fun. Hope you all are enjoy your Thanksgiving

12/10/22, 1:22 PM - Chris Bro: Following up on Eric’s question about the old home video Dixon Carols, Andrea made copies of this and lots of other Dixon home videos on DVD that she gave to all of you a few years ago. Not sure if any of you still have a DVD player, but you may be able to find that DVD if you search through your DVD collection. when Grace gets home from college for Christmas break, we can also see if we can figure out how to make a version that can be shared electronically. Please let me know if anybody still has a DVD player and can’t find their old DVD and would like a new DVD version.
12/10/22, 1:22 PM - Chris Bro: Also, do we have any set plans yet for getting together around Christmas?
12/10/22, 1:30 PM - Lori Alarcon: Dinner at Morgan’s on Christmas Day(right Morg?)
Family recreation in Phoenix day after Christmas(zoo or there’s this cool aquarium that Charly told us about that she and Estevan visited recently)
Our tentative plans are to try and do these things 👆y’all figure out and confirm what you’ll be doing and we will do our best to join in🎄❤️
12/10/22, 2:45 PM - Modge Podge: Sounds good to me. The aquarium sounds fun too, maybe zoo less expensive???, Also fun
12/10/22, 2:46 PM - Eric Dixon: Chris that sounds familiar! I'll have to dig through our DVDs to see if I can find it
12/10/22, 2:47 PM - Modge Podge: So, what's for dinner??
12/10/22, 2:51 PM - Modge Podge: Electronic version of Dixon carols!!!

People are welcome to stay at our home. We have two bedrooms with full over full bunks and two other rooms each with full mattresses all available for use. 

Just let me know who all is coming, what days, and if you’re staying the night.
12/12/22, 5:08 PM - Mogey: Lori I believe you are the only confirmed Christmas Day family joining us. And Christmas Day will be just Corey and I. I get my kids back either late Christmas Day or at 9am on Monday.
12/12/22, 5:09 PM - Mindy Montgomery-Dixon: We can be involved in all activities on the 26th, not sure if we can for Christmas day.
12/12/22, 5:12 PM - Chris Bro: We can definitely be there all day on Monday Dec. 26 and Maybe Tuesday Dec 27 as well. Anyone else available on Tuesday?
12/12/22, 5:13 PM - Lori Alarcon: Nothing is confirmed for us- just tentative. We might not make it up to Phoenix until Monday
12/12/22, 5:14 PM - Mogey: I can be available Tuesday. I work from 9-2 but can hang out after and my kids can hang out before
12/12/22, 8:15 PM - Modge Podge: We will come the 26th.
12/12/22, 9:00 PM - Corey Lowe: Morgan says, “It’s Christmas or norhing!!”
12/12/22, 9:00 PM - Corey Lowe: *nothing
12/12/22, 9:00 PM - Corey Lowe: Her words not mine
12/12/22, 9:00 PM - Corey Lowe: She did say Norhing
12/13/22, 2:21 PM - Mindy Montgomery-Dixon: https://youtu.be/C-QHbpYjuIg

My sis just sent me this song.  It's beautiful and fits Christmas so well!
12/13/22, 2:22 PM - Lori Alarcon: Charly sang this for a Christmas event a few years back-it’s good!
12/13/22, 2:23 PM - Mindy Montgomery-Dixon: I would love to hear her sing it!  She has such a beautiful voice!
12/16/22, 12:09 AM - Mares Eatoats: <Media omitted>
12/16/22, 12:09 AM - Mares Eatoats: Damián would like to his warmest Christmas wishes to all!
12/16/22, 12:09 AM - Mares Eatoats: Send
12/16/22, 12:10 AM - Lori Alarcon: Don Gato!🎄⭐️
12/16/22, 12:12 AM - Mase: We accept those warmest wishes, but why didn't Damian send it. Something seems fishy here🤣
12/16/22, 12:12 AM - Mares Eatoats: Oh I’m sure he is less than jolly about me sending it
12/16/22, 12:13 AM - Lori Alarcon: Hmm Masons right…
Where is Damian right now, do you even know?
12/16/22, 12:13 AM - Mares Eatoats: I’ll show you what he’s doing
12/16/22, 12:13 AM - Mares Eatoats: <Media omitted>
12/16/22, 12:14 AM - Mares Eatoats: <Media omitted>
12/16/22, 12:16 AM - Mase: Wow, MaryAnn you are spamming Damian pictures at us. I mean they are pretty cool. Are you using filters or some of those new AI art program creators?
12/16/22, 12:17 AM - Corey Lowe: AI for sure
12/16/22, 12:17 AM - Mares Eatoats: Damián just caught on to what I was doing
12/16/22, 12:18 AM - Damian K Y: It is an AI thing I’m trying. Some people say it is risky to use it for privacy reasons. But I just find out that my privacy is more at risk just sending things to Maryann
12/16/22, 12:18 AM - Mase: Hahaha
12/16/22, 12:18 AM - Lori Alarcon: 😂😂😂
12/16/22, 12:20 AM - Mase: Honestly the AI art possibilities are pretty freaking cool... I think it's time to see a picture of Holly Jolly Mares, that might even the score a bit.
12/16/22, 11:05 AM - Modge Podge: 😂😂😂 MORE!
12/17/22, 8:01 PM - Chris Bro: Just received the sad news that Susanne Gottstein passed away. She is the sister of Mike Walston (married to Katie, MaryAnn’s friend). Please keep their family in your thoughts and prayers.
12/17/22, 8:06 PM - Mares Eatoats: Oh no…do you know what happened?
12/17/22, 8:12 PM - Chris Bro: Her husband is not sure. It was not expected. She has had some health challenges lately however she seemed to be doing OK. Today she suddenly and unexpectedly stopped breathing. The paramedics came and took her to the hospital but she was not able to be resuscitated.
12/17/22, 8:18 PM - Mares Eatoats: Oh my gosh…that is so terrible. I’ll keep their family in my prayers
12/18/22, 12:06 AM - Mase: That is rough, we will keep them in our prayers😞
12/18/22, 2:56 PM - Modge Podge: So sorry to hear that!  She is young! How old are her children??
12/18/22, 2:58 PM - Modge Podge: Your Uncle David Dutton's address for anyone who might be sending Christmas cards:. 3456 E Elida Tucson Az 85716
12/18/22, 3:58 PM - Mindy Montgomery-Dixon: So sorry to hear about your friend.  😟

Thanks for the address Nina!  Do you have one for Wes and Gene and any of their kids?
12/18/22, 4:02 PM - Modge Podge: Wes and Gene Warren 418 N 2nd Coeur d' Alene, ID 83814
12/18/22, 4:07 PM - Modge Podge: Chris and Marianne Thornton: 2115 W Jesse Ct, Rathdrum, ID 83858
12/18/22, 4:11 PM - Modge Podge: Philip and Jessica and Weldon could get mail at the Allied Weldery shop too 418 N 2nd
12/18/22, 4:39 PM - Mindy Montgomery-Dixon: Thanks Nina!
12/18/22, 4:42 PM - Corey Lowe: Watch 13 Lives on Amazon with  Viggo
12/18/22, 4:42 PM - Corey Lowe: It’s great
12/18/22, 4:43 PM - Corey Lowe: Meant for my family chat
12/18/22, 4:43 PM - Corey Lowe: But still watch it
12/20/22, 11:00 AM - Chris Bro: Just following up on plans for getting together at Morgan’s for Christmas. We are planning to spend all day Monday 12/26 there and maybe Tuesday. What time will those that are going be arriving on Monday? And how long are you staying? Should we bring side dishes or anything else?
12/20/22, 11:26 AM - Mindy Montgomery-Dixon: We will be around all day on Monday.  And, yes let us now how we can help with food.

What is everyone's address?
12/20/22, 11:58 AM - Mogey: I’ve made some calls today. I tentatively booked the wildlife world zoo at a pretty hefty group rate but the Reid park zoo at regular pricing is still about $100 cheaper for the whole estimated group of us. I’m still waiting on official pricing from both places to be sure. 

Difference with Reid park zoo is we’d probably go out to eat somewhere after the zoo whereas the wildlife world zoo, we can come back and hangout at my house and have dinner there.  

Does anyone have a preference of Tucson vs Phoenix and/or a preference on which zoo you’d like to go to for the daytime activities?
12/20/22, 12:02 PM - Mogey: Also the zoo is a giant family gift from Mom and Dale so either option will be free to your and your families. So the choice comes down to which city and where you want to go for the evening
12/20/22, 12:08 PM - Chris Bro: That is very kind of Mom and Dale to offer. However, given that it sounds like we only have one day together, on Monday, and you are working til 2pm that day, it might be best to just hangout at your house and enjoy each other’s company.
12/20/22, 12:37 PM - Mogey: I will actually be done with work closer to 11/11:30 so taking the kids out of the house to the zoo for a couple hours could be fun.
12/20/22, 12:38 PM - Mogey: I’m partial to staying in the west valley becasue I live here but the cost to Reid park is a lot cheaper
12/20/22, 12:38 PM - Mogey: Everyone weigh in please so we can make final plans
12/20/22, 12:49 PM - Chris Bro: I don’t feel strongly however, I would lean toward not doing the Zoo as all of our kids are older and the Zoo is not very exciting for them anymore. (Not sure if Lori’s kids and Mason and Morgan’s older kids feel the same). However, if everyone else feels strongly about the Zoo, we are happy to go and help pay for it. If we are only getting together on Monday and want to make the zoo part of that, it makes the most sense to go the zoo closest to Morgan’s house. 
Another alternative would be to hang out at Morgan’s on Monday and those that want to could do the Zoo in Tucson on Tuesday. 
Morgan, you are hosting so I think you get to make the final call on the plans.
12/20/22, 10:43 PM - Mogey: Ok change of plans. 

We are nixing the zoo.
12/20/22, 10:47 PM - Mogey: Now we are meeting at my house at everyone’s earliest convenience on the 26th. 

We will go to a park to have park game style fun. Pickle ball, volleyball, croquet, corn hole, kub, kan jam, and maybe a little family kickball game. 

Then we will have dinner catered by little Italy which is a fun Italian restaurant near my house. Mom is providing the meal. If anyone would like to bring desserts or snacks to share, great but otherwise I will have a cheesecake and a no salt chocolate cake (for mom) and a selection of veggies. 

Dinner will be at 5:30 and we can spend the rest of the evening playing games and hangin out at our house.
12/20/22, 10:48 PM - Mogey: Sound good?
12/20/22, 10:50 PM - Corey Lowe: Do I have a choice??!!!
12/20/22, 10:57 PM - Mindy Montgomery-Dixon: That all sounds fantastic!  Thanks for planning it all!

12/25/22, 11:01 AM - Mogey: Did anyone’s kids get a new phone for Christmas in Tucson that is texting Corey and I a merry Christmas? We both got a text from a number we don’t recognize which we would usually just delete as spam. Thought I’d check here first?
12/25/22, 11:02 AM - Mase: Not here, my kids only got coal and a box o sox
12/25/22, 11:02 AM - Corey Lowe: That’s awesome
12/25/22, 11:04 AM - Mogey: I remember getting a box o Sox one year. But it was followed up by actual MOON SHOES! Sounds like a pretty great Christmas at the Dixon house

12/26/22, 12:07 AM - Corey Lowe: I had a hard time saying something nice about your lame guitar playing but it’s Christmas after all
12/26/22, 12:08 AM - Corey Lowe: It was actually really great. I enjoyed it and I usually don’t like musical numbers in church
12/26/22, 12:18 AM - Eric Dixon: Thanks man!
12/26/22, 12:29 AM - Mase: Pretty sweet man! I thought guitar playing was banned in church because of Dad. I'm glad they lifted the ban just this once
12/26/22, 9:25 AM - Eric Dixon: They recently updated the rules on that I guess. Up to the bishoprics discretion. I considered playing baby got back to see if I could get guitars banned again in the spirit of dad, but little drummer boy won the vote 🙄

2/9/23, 9:37 PM - Mogey: What the?! I thought you were going to be here for my birthday?! What happened to flying back April 7th??
2/9/23, 10:10 PM - Mares Eatoats: And what happened to being in Spain??
2/9/23, 11:34 PM - Eric Dixon: We were only going to push it to April 7th if the sealing was getting moved up.
2/9/23, 11:34 PM - Eric Dixon: Mares, if you were in Spain during Maine winters we'd definitely go there too.
2/9/23, 11:41 PM - Eric Dixon: (but we aren't ruling out Spain yet!)

2/26/23, 5:00 PM - Mogey: <Media omitted>
2/26/23, 5:01 PM - Mogey: Also I’m sure you were an amazing bishop and will be missed in that role, Chris. I imagine you’re feeling relief as well and gratitude for the opportunity it was💕
2/26/23, 5:03 PM - Lori Alarcon: ❤️❤️
2/26/23, 6:25 PM - Modge Podge: Wonderful experience to be able to be there with you and feel the  memorable spirit and love that was in this meeting 💕  Thank you for sharing this special moment with us.  You and Andrea both did your part- with all of your heart- to bring the Olivero Ward closer to Christ.  - even as life happened!
2/26/23, 6:44 PM - Eric Dixon: That's crazy Chris! Good luck on life after bishop! Does the new bishop happen to be an ASU fan? Cuz that would make a lot more sense why that half court shot went in 🙏🙏🙏
2/26/23, 6:46 PM - Lori Alarcon: 😂
2/26/23, 7:15 PM - Chris Bro: Thanks for the kind words and comments everyone and Thanks Morgan for recording it! Eric, the new bishop is actually a Utah State Grad. If my being bishop had influence on the Wildcats’ success, we would be aiming for our 6th national championship this year…but would now end up losing in the first round to a 15 seed.
2/27/23, 5:41 PM - Chris Bro: Hi Mason, Mindy, Mom, Grandma, and Dale. Have been communicating with Eric, Erin, Morgan, and Corey about all of us coming up to snowflake/Overgaard this weekend. Knowing that grandma will be leaving on March 8, we want to make sure to get to see her before she goes. Will defer to Eric, Erin, Morgan, and Corey regarding plans for their families. From my family, it would just be Isa and I. We would likely arrive late Saturday afternoon and return home Sunday afternoon. We could stay in Overgaard or snowflake, depending on who has space or can stay in a hotel as well. Are you all good with hosting this weekend? Alarcon’s, any chance you guys make it up to snowflake this weekend?
2/27/23, 6:03 PM - Mogey: We’ll go and maybe plan to stay with Mason and Mindy’s clan since there are more of us than Dixon’s?
2/27/23, 6:11 PM - Lori Alarcon: We won’t make it this weekend- have fun❤️
2/27/23, 7:14 PM - Mindy Montgomery-Dixon: We are more than happy to host all you guys.  Mason will be out of town from wed night- Sunday night.  So he won't be around.
2/27/23, 7:18 PM - Mogey: Where’s mason going to be??
2/27/23, 7:20 PM - Mindy Montgomery-Dixon: My dad's bday was this last Fri and it has become tradition that all the boys that can make it do a dunes trip together.  So he will be without kids or wives, just enjoy quad riding with the guys.  They might get back late on sat, so he might be home Sunday morning.  Not sure exactly.

3/14/23, 11:53 AM - Chris Bro: Is this a semipro league in Hong Kong, Relief society league, or just pump’d for March madness?
3/14/23, 11:54 AM - Damian K Y: Well, she was the tallest that’s for sure
3/14/23, 11:54 AM - Damian K Y: I don’t know the level though
3/14/23, 12:07 PM - Mares Eatoats: I’m by far the WORST on the team. It’s a city league and they’re all pretty serious about it except for my team which is just playing to have fun
3/14/23, 12:09 PM - Mase: That's cool Mares! Just pretend like you are playing horse, cuz then you'll be lights out from everywhere on the court😄
3/14/23, 12:11 PM - Chris Bro: And enough with the humility. Go into it with the same cockiness as if you were playing against your older brothers and you’ll tear it up
3/14/23, 12:14 PM - Mares Eatoats: You make a very good point! I should do that!
3/14/23, 12:15 PM - Mares Eatoats: I’m one of the tallest on the team and I’m playing down by the basket! I’m not used to that!
3/14/23, 12:36 PM - Mase: Ah, you should learn some post moves. Just watch some Shaq highlights and you'll be dominating in no time
3/14/23, 12:38 PM - Chris Bro: I don’t think Shaq techniques are going to work for you Mares. Try watching some Manute Bol highlights

4/16/23, 4:58 PM - Lori Alarcon: Right 🫵🎉
4/16/23, 10:31 PM - Mogey: Hey guys! Tentative plans for our sealing:

Eric and MaryAnn are flying in Friday night. 
Saturday morning, per Mares’ request, we will eat at TJ’s here in Goodyear. We will provide some basic lunch options for everyone and then on to the sealing in the evening. 

Corey and I will decide on a restaurant to meet up with anyone that would like to eat with us after the sealing (currently leaning toward Joe’s Farm Grill in Gilbert but VERY open to ideas with good parking, pricing, and not a long wait). 

Anyone is welcome to stay the night into Sunday. Our ward meets at 11:30. I’ll have breakfast and planning on a crock pot earlyish lunch/dinner of maybe pulled pork sandwiches or something so we can maximize hangout time. 

Hopefully the weather will be great to either hangout outside or head to a park. 

I only know officially that MaryAnn and Eric are staying with us and Chris and Andrea are getting a hotel. 

My kids will stay in our room with us to free up 4 other bedrooms and a total of 6 beds (full size mattresses). All family is welcome to stay! Let me know asap so I can plan accordingly
4/17/23, 12:09 AM - Mindy Montgomery-Dixon: We would love to stay with you guys on sat night!  We won't get into town until the sealing, to much going on here sat morning.  How long are Eric and MaryAnn staying?!
4/17/23, 12:54 AM - Mogey: Maryann Monday morning. Eric leaves Tuesday
4/18/23, 10:19 AM - Modge Podge: Happy Birthday Erin ❣️🥳🎂🥰

4/22/23, 11:58 AM - Corey Lowe: I think you should do the whole head like that!
4/23/23, 7:19 PM - Mogey: Ok. Here’s the lineup for Saturday night.

Sealing is at 5. Corey and I have to leave our house by 3 to be there at 4. Anyone else at our home will want to leave by about 3:40 to be at the temple about 4:40. 

Pictures are immediately following the sealing. Corey and I and the kids will stick around for a few extra pictures after the main group pictures. 

Everyone else can head over to Mici Italian Eatery. 5498 S Power Rd #101, Gilbert, AZ 85295

We have the patio reserved for seating. Everyone can order their food as they arrive. And we will mingle with everyone the whole evening there before heading back home.
4/23/23, 8:24 PM - Corey Lowe: I mean…I dunno about this plan Morgan?!!? I mean…forever!!?? That’s a really long time!

4/27/23, 12:39 AM - Mares Eatoats: Happy birthday Mindy! I think you should request Mason to do that move as a birthday present to you!
4/27/23, 2:05 AM - Mogey: Hey would everyone be ok with Ava getting baptized on May 20 at 10am? I could try to ask for later in the day but I usually get a lot of pushback when I make requests and right now I’m just grateful a certain someone has agreed to baptizing Ava in May at all…

But we would love as many AZ family as possible to make it if they can so let me know if it’s a doable timeframe
4/27/23, 3:11 AM - Mares Eatoats: I’d prefer this weekend…

4/27/23, 11:58 AM - Mogey: Here in Goodyear
4/27/23, 12:05 PM - Mogey: Jared is planning on baptizing his wife the same day and trying to push for Ava’s first and then Melissa right after. It doesn’t leave room for an after party with Ava. But I’m trying to work out more time with the kids if I can.
4/28/23, 6:12 PM - Modge Podge: For your sealing... Do you want us in Sunday dress or white??
4/28/23, 6:16 PM - Mogey: Sunday dress
4/28/23, 6:38 PM - Eric Dixon: What if we want to wear white to upstage the bride (mason wanted me to ask)

In a stunning twist of events Denali has been throwing up all morning(feeding the queen according to Eric)so we are going to head back home early. It was lovely seeing you all and being a part of Morgan and Corey’s sealing. Until next time….🫶🏻
4/30/23, 2:53 PM - Mogey: Oh no! That’s such a bummer! We were looking forward to having you guys all day today! I hope Denali feels better!
4/30/23, 2:54 PM - Corey Lowe: I don’t like this at all! We’ll really miss you guys today. I hope Denali gets better!
4/30/23, 3:17 PM - Eric Dixon: Condolences for the manner in which Denali had to feed the queen. Hope he gets better so he can feed the queen in a more traditional fashion soon

5/28/23, 9:21 PM - Lori Alarcon: Julian was away this past week on a top secret mission. These pics and videos are you clues. What is he doing??!!🧐🤔
5/28/23, 9:21 PM - Lori Alarcon: Mom don’t chime in😁
5/28/23, 10:01 PM - Modge Podge: 🤐uhmmph
5/28/23, 10:02 PM - Mogey: Is he is a Book of Mormon remake movie??
5/28/23, 10:02 PM - Mogey: That’s an insane makeover by the way
5/28/23, 10:05 PM - Chris Bro: I agree with Morgan’s guess. That is awesome! Does he have a lead role?
5/28/23, 10:07 PM - Corey Lowe: This is obviously the next installment in the Twilight Saga!
5/28/23, 10:07 PM - Eric Dixon: Dances with wolves: the Last Dance?
5/28/23, 10:26 PM - Mindy Montgomery-Dixon: Mason guess is The First of the Mohicans!
5/28/23, 11:16 PM - Mares Eatoats: I agree with this one
5/30/23, 6:48 PM - Lori Alarcon: Sooo…the church has been in contact with Julian since about 2019 to recruit him for Book of Mormon videos they have been filming representing the timeline of the BOM. He was being filmed as an extra background actor playing the part of a “fierce lamanite warrior “ They were filming sections of 3rd Nephi in Provo Utah, which is where Julian reported for 2 days of filming. His team of 5 lamanites were in charge of killing Mormon. There were lots of battle scenes which took over 27 hours. We’ll see if any of the scenes that Julian appeared in make the final cut. It just never worked out until this year for him to do it. It got cxled during COVID, and when they first reached out to him, there were scheduling conflicts. Although this was a new and exciting adventure for Julian, the whole time he was filming, he was pretending he was in the movie ‘The First of the Mohicans’ And yes, his Mohawk has his real hair in it!!🎉🫶🏻
5/30/23, 6:53 PM - Mares Eatoats: Well he makes a really good lamanite warrior! Those pictures scared the crap out of me
5/30/23, 7:27 PM - Mogey: That is pretty dang cool. Did he enjoy the process of becoming a lamanite, and all the filming, etc?
5/30/23, 7:39 PM - Lori Alarcon: Yes everything was new to him being on a film set etc. and was a very memorable experience!
5/30/23, 7:40 PM - Mares Eatoats: So cool!!
5/30/23, 7:41 PM - Mindy Montgomery-Dixon: That's so cool!  I hope they use the scene's he was in!  I love the mohawk!  I expect to see it in person next time we get together!
5/30/23, 7:47 PM - Mogey: Yes if he could actually recreate that at every family function from here on out, that would be great
5/30/23, 8:02 PM - Mase: That is awesome, and looked like a ton of fun! Julian looked awesome as a lamanite!
5/30/23, 9:06 PM - Corey Lowe: Pretty awesome experience I’m sure. I’ll admit I’m a little bummed out it wasn’t for the next Twilight film. One can still dream though!
5/31/23, 5:47 AM - Mares Eatoats: <Media omitted>
5/31/23, 8:51 AM - Eric Dixon: Will do mares. Sorry to hear that
5/31/23, 9:33 AM - Mogey: Oh no! poor girl. Will do
5/31/23, 10:09 AM - Corey Lowe: For sure! Hope you’re all doing well:)
5/31/23, 10:12 AM - Mase: Of course! Poor little girl. We'll keep her in our prayers
5/31/23, 10:38 AM - Modge Podge: Arlet ❣️Yes you are in our prayers 💕💕
5/31/23, 11:01 AM - Lori Alarcon: Sending prayers🙏

6/1/23, 12:22 PM - Modge Podge: Most of us don't look as adorable as she does when we're sick! So GLAD she is doing better ❣️
6/4/23, 5:40 PM - Chris Bro: Been thinking about our brother Ben today as it is the anniversary of his passing. Actually started thinking about him yesterday after watching the new SpiderMan with my kids. Won’t give any spoilers but had some interesting thoughts after watching it related to Ben. I am so grateful that he is our brother and grateful that some day we will see him again. Love you all
6/4/23, 5:51 PM - Mogey: He’s been on my mind since yesterday too. I actually had the chance to talk about him with coworkers on Friday which felt nice to just talk about him
6/4/23, 6:06 PM - Lori Alarcon: I love and miss Ben❤️❤️
6/4/23, 7:07 PM - Mase: Love you guys and miss Ben.

Your influence clearly helps your own families but it is also a wonderful example for me to watch and have my kids learn from.  I am so grateful for all of you: Dale, Julian, Chris, Mason, Damian, Corey, Eric and of course our father and Ben. Love you all 💕
6/18/23, 1:52 PM - Corey Lowe: Yes!!!!! I came in right before Eric! In your face Eric!
6/18/23, 1:53 PM - Corey Lowe: Thank you Morgan;)
6/18/23, 1:56 PM - Modge Podge: Happy Father's Day to each one of you son's and son's-in-laws ❣️ You are each beyond amazing fathers, uncles, brothers, leaders, protectors, counselors, encouragers, comforters and tons of fun ❣️❣️💕💕💕

6/27/23, 9:06 PM - Eric Dixon: So, we bought a house (at least they accepted our offer) 😅
6/27/23, 9:06 PM - Corey Lowe: In Snowflake right?
6/27/23, 9:06 PM - Eric Dixon: (sorry not in Arizona 😄)
6/27/23, 9:07 PM - Corey Lowe: …
6/27/23, 9:07 PM - Mogey: That was just mean. You’re not supposed to buy unless it’s in az
6/27/23, 9:09 PM - Eric Dixon: I know... Sorry
6/27/23, 9:09 PM - Mogey: Where’d you buy?
6/27/23, 9:10 PM - Corey Lowe: Still awesome for you guys! Do you have the address so we can check it out?
6/27/23, 9:12 PM - Mogey: Does that mean we’ll be helping you pack while we visit? You can totally put us to work
6/27/23, 9:12 PM - Mogey: We get to go see it at least right?
6/27/23, 9:12 PM - Eric Dixon: Thanks! Yeah, so it's in Durham about 15 minutes away from where we currently are.  Its a bit of a fixer upper...
6/27/23, 9:13 PM - Eric Dixon: https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/1515-Royalsborough-Road-Durham-ME-04222/122994763_zpid/?utm_campaign=androidappmessage&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=txtshare
6/27/23, 10:34 PM - Chris Bro: Congrats Eric and Erin! Hopefully some day we will make it out to Maine to visit
6/27/23, 10:35 PM - Eric Dixon: Thanks Chris! You definitely should!
6/27/23, 10:41 PM - Mogey: How fun! Congrats. It looks great. When do you close?
6/27/23, 10:47 PM - Modge Podge: That definitely looks like a great house! Maybe not Lester Moe 😀 What are your favorite buying points??
6/27/23, 10:53 PM - Eric Dixon: The scary factor. We are hoping to be featured on the cover of a Stephen King novel
6/27/23, 10:58 PM - Eric Dixon: But really, it is a solidly built house with more space that is not very old (relatively speaking) with a lot of potential in an area we really like. The roof and the heating system in it are brand new
6/27/23, 11:00 PM - Corey Lowe: Does it have a basement?
6/27/23, 11:00 PM - Corey Lowe: That’s awesome
6/27/23, 11:09 PM - Eric Dixon: Yup
6/27/23, 11:09 PM - Eric Dixon: Finishable basement
6/27/23, 11:09 PM - Corey Lowe: 😎
6/27/23, 11:26 PM - Mogey: So are you selling your current house or keeping it and renting?
6/27/23, 11:28 PM - Modge Podge: Where is your office??
6/27/23, 11:35 PM - Modge Podge: Are those real wood floors??? Great views from the windows!
6/27/23, 11:39 PM - Modge Podge: Vintage kitchen ❣️ Love the porch! Better BYO mower. Was the finishable basement in the photos? The bedrooms look really big.
6/28/23, 4:22 AM - Mares Eatoats: Wow that house looks amazing!
6/28/23, 4:24 AM - Mares Eatoats: I anticipate trembling in fear on the drive up to your house through the fog as is per normal with those Maine houses
6/28/23, 12:19 PM - Mase: Duuude! The house looks pretty cool and it's on 2 acres! Crossing my fingers that they take your offer. Let us know when it goes through.
6/28/23, 1:02 PM - Eric Dixon: We will have to sell it to be able to make updates to the next house, but we'll close on the new house before closing on ours
6/28/23, 1:03 PM - Eric Dixon: The floors are wood and the office will be upstairs. No, the basement wasn't in the photos
6/28/23, 1:19 PM - Mogey: Is the basement not included in square footage then because it’s unfinished? How big is it?
6/28/23, 1:20 PM - Corey Lowe: That’s correct Morgie:)
6/28/23, 1:31 PM - Eric Dixon: So almost 2000sqft not including the basement
6/28/23, 3:02 PM - Mogey: Right. How big is the basement?
6/28/23, 3:08 PM - Corey Lowe: Also, what’s the basement parameters?
6/28/23, 3:13 PM - Mares Eatoats: So basically Morgan and Corey are wondering if they could live in your basement comfortably
6/28/23, 3:17 PM - Eric Dixon: Probably about as big as each floor give or take, so maybe 800-1000 sqft?
6/28/23, 3:18 PM - Corey Lowe: But why male models?
6/28/23, 3:18 PM - Chris Bro: Basically the size of the house we all used to live in on Linden street. So 9 people could easily live comfortably in your basement.
6/28/23, 3:19 PM - Eric Dixon: Not sure you could live in it comfortably yet... Unless your smeagolish
6/28/23, 3:21 PM - Mares Eatoats: Corey reminds me of him…
6/28/23, 3:22 PM - Corey Lowe: Morgan tells me that all the time too!
6/28/23, 3:22 PM - Corey Lowe: Sisters think alike!
6/28/23, 3:24 PM - Eric Dixon: Probably cuz of the smell
6/28/23, 3:24 PM - Eric Dixon: (if there is such a thing)
6/28/23, 3:25 PM - Corey Lowe: No, it’s my eating habits
6/28/23, 3:56 PM - Lori Alarcon: That’s awesome you guys!  I always loved houses with basements🙌
Harder to find in the Tucson area
7/3/23, 9:17 PM - Eric Dixon: In a stunning turn of events we are no longer getting the "scary" house. Our current house is officially under contract though 😅
7/3/23, 9:19 PM - Mase: Hmm, that seems problematic. Your house is under contract and you don't have a house to move into. Is it time to try your hand at RVing?
7/3/23, 9:20 PM - Eric Dixon: We are putting another offer in on a house 6 minutes away from us, but if that doesn't work out, RV here we come! 🥳🚙🏕️
7/3/23, 9:20 PM - Chris Bro: Time to come back to AZ! You know all of our houses are open to you. You can work remotely for the next year while you search for your dream home
7/3/23, 9:24 PM - Mogey: I like Chris’s plan. I’ve been trying to get you to move in with us since you started making longer trips to az!
7/3/23, 9:41 PM - Eric Dixon: As long as we can stay in the dog suite
7/3/23, 10:23 PM - Modge Podge: HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO DAMIAN 🥳🥳🥳😃
7/3/23, 10:34 PM - Mares Eatoats: It’s the year to come to Hong Kong!
7/3/23, 10:36 PM - Lori Alarcon: Don Gato! Happy Birthday!🎉!

7/4/23, 12:39 PM - Corey Lowe: How dare you! Her head is perfect!
7/4/23, 1:05 PM - Mares Eatoats: She looks the best she’s ever looked in that picture
7/4/23, 1:06 PM - Corey Lowe: Finally! Someone shows some grace and maturity!

7/20/23, 12:37 AM - Chris Bro: You met Phillip (father of the baby above) in Blackfoot Idaho right before my wedding. He would have been about 10 or 11 at the time. A little younger than Eric. You accused him of cheating when we were playing Mafia at Andrea’s parents’ house

Congratulations Axel! How cool to have so much family there to celebrate with you
8/5/23, 4:30 PM - Corey Lowe: <Media omitted>
8/5/23, 5:09 PM - Mase: Haha, no idea why that picture attached to her post
8/5/23, 5:54 PM - Mindy Montgomery-Dixon: That's not supposed to be there!  😂😂
8/6/23, 3:58 PM - Mogey: I was just reminded about Grace’s endowment next week so I reserved the session for 2pm for Corey and I. Just a reminder for anyone that hasn’t done that yet. I saw 28 seats available when I signed up
8/6/23, 6:27 PM - Chris Bro: Thank you Scouter. I was about to send out a reminder. Her endowment session is this Saturday Aug 12 at 2pm at the Tucson Temple.  Please let us know (and make sure to reserve a seat on the temple website) if you are coming. Also let us know if anyone would like to stay the night Friday and/or Saturday. 
Looking forward to seeing many of you this weekend!
8/11/23, 11:22 AM - Chris Bro: Looking forward to seeing you all at the temple tomorrow for Grace’s endowment. Please arrive by 1:15. Andrea is asking that everyone do a family name. Please let us know if you don’t have a family name and we can prepare one for you.
8/11/23, 11:53 AM - Mogey: Corey and I do not have a family name
8/12/23, 4:19 PM - Mogey: We are here at the temple and will be in the waiting room to the right when you first walk in.
8/12/23, 4:24 PM - Chris Bro: I’m here as well in the same waiting room
8/12/23, 4:25 PM - Mindy Montgomery-Dixon: We are finishing eating eegees and should be there in 15

8/13/23, 3:17 AM - Lori Alarcon: 😂
8/15/23, 4:01 AM - Mares Eatoats: Let it be known that day 1 arlet already has a note home from the teacher about her behavior…
8/15/23, 4:12 AM - Mogey: Probably about how cute her behavior is
8/15/23, 4:23 AM - Mares Eatoats: Nope she’s a runner
8/15/23, 10:44 AM - Modge Podge: Arlet ❣️ This could be an entertaining year 😃
8/15/23, 10:53 AM - Eric Dixon: Sounds like she's just imitating her mom. I mean at least she's not imitating her aunt and throwing sand from the banister  😱
8/15/23, 1:37 PM - Corey Lowe: Is she wearing a vest as she runs away too?
8/15/23, 3:22 PM - Eric Dixon: Made of real gorilla chest?

9/9/23, 8:15 PM - Mares Eatoats: True story
9/9/23, 8:16 PM - Lori Alarcon: Said the shrimp from Shark Tale
9/9/23, 8:53 PM - Eric Dixon: I just want to say thank you to President Monson for sharing a birthday with me, I'm also thankful that we don't live in a place that has potholes the size of cars (ours are only the size of bowling balls). Also, in a foot note, on a side note, and in fine print, thanks for the birthday wishes.
9/9/23, 8:53 PM - Lori Alarcon: *Nelson
9/9/23, 8:54 PM - Eric Dixon: Clearly, I'm getting older
9/9/23, 8:55 PM - Lori Alarcon: Nope you’ll always be the baby of the family per our convo❤️

10/4/23, 8:57 PM - Mares Eatoats: Hey all! I was thinking since we’ll be down for Christmas and all that we could pull another house party like we did over Easter a couple years back. We were thinking doing a 2 night stay somewhere in the Tucson or Phoenix area Dec 30 - Jan 1
10/4/23, 8:58 PM - Mares Eatoats: Who’s in??
10/4/23, 9:03 PM - Corey Lowe: Count me in!
10/4/23, 9:04 PM - Corey Lowe: Not sure about Morgan…
10/4/23, 9:05 PM - Eric Dixon: Count us in! We fly in the 28th 🥳
10/4/23, 9:06 PM - Mares Eatoats: Morgan is in
10/4/23, 9:06 PM - Corey Lowe: <Media omitted>
10/4/23, 9:07 PM - Mares Eatoats: She looks like she’s thinking really hard
10/4/23, 9:07 PM - Eric Dixon: Why so serious?
10/4/23, 9:07 PM - Corey Lowe: She’s doing some basic math
10/4/23, 9:08 PM - Corey Lowe: She’s phoning a friend
10/4/23, 9:39 PM - Lori Alarcon: Julian’s in! (Just Julian)😉
10/4/23, 9:39 PM - Corey Lowe: Permission granted!
10/4/23, 9:40 PM - Lori Alarcon: You mean …”Permission to come aboard?”
10/4/23, 9:40 PM - Mase: 12x12 got her again🤣
10/4/23, 9:40 PM - Corey Lowe: Well I was answering that question;)
10/4/23, 10:25 PM - Chris Bro: We are in
10/8/23, 7:18 PM - Chris Bro: Who is going to be in charge of setting up VRBO? The Dec 30-Jan 1 dates that Maryann mentioned work for our family. We will not be available Dec 28 (our anniversary) or 29. I will also be off work and available Dec 23-27 and Jan2-7 if anyone wants to come stay at our house for a few days or make additional plans while the Sayaz’s and Eric Dixon family are in AZ
10/8/23, 7:20 PM - Mogey: I think mares is working on the house. I sent her some favorites from a few she’s found.
10/8/23, 7:23 PM - Mogey: I’m Happy to host a Christmas Eve dinner at our house. Or we could do the 23rd if people want to just be with their families on Christmas Eve into Christmas?
10/8/23, 7:23 PM - Mares Eatoats: Happy to find the place but was wondering if someone would be open to paying because last time trying to pay and transfer money abroad is a bit tricky
10/8/23, 7:24 PM - Mogey: I can do that. Is everyone good with zelle and/or Venmo for paying me back?
10/8/23, 7:46 PM - Modge Podge: Sounds good to me 😃💕
10/8/23, 7:46 PM - Chris Bro: Yes
10/8/23, 7:47 PM - Mase: Of course!!!
10/8/23, 7:47 PM - Chris Bro: Doing something at Morgan’s on Dec 23 sounds good to me
10/8/23, 9:43 PM - Mindy Montgomery-Dixon: What area are we wanting to find a place?  Also, my vote is to stay until the 2nd,  because staying up for New years Eve and then having to leave the next day sounds awful
10/8/23, 9:50 PM - Mindy Montgomery-Dixon: Also the 23rd works for us!  I love going to Morgan's and am also open to hosting ( that would be amazing option for GMA to be there).
10/8/23, 10:09 PM - Mogey: I’m open to letting snowflake Dixon’s host the 23rd and then we can have carry over fun at our house after the reunion for as long as anyone wants to stay?
10/9/23, 10:50 AM - Mares Eatoats: <Media omitted>
10/9/23, 10:50 AM - Mares Eatoats: Found this gem in my phone today
10/9/23, 12:09 PM - Mogey: Let’s make sure we do more of that when we’re all together
10/9/23, 6:56 PM - Chris Bro: Following up on messages yesterday, We are open to the 23rd at Morgan’s or Snowflake
10/9/23, 7:00 PM - Mares Eatoats: Us too
10/9/23, 8:43 PM - Modge Podge: I LOVE hearing you all sing 💕💕❤️
10/14/23, 8:14 PM - Mares Eatoats: Quick confirmation about dates for our New Year’s Eve fun…Mindy suggested staying until the 2nd I’m going to send a quick poll so just choose which works best
10/14/23, 8:15 PM - Mares Eatoats: POLL:
Which date
OPTION: Dec 30 - Jan 2 (6 votes)
OPTION: Dec 30 - Jan 1 (3 votes)

10/14/23, 9:41 PM - Mogey: I’ll have to work on the 2nd and the kids will have to go back to their dads
10/14/23, 11:48 PM - Mares Eatoats: Chris what date works for you
10/14/23, 11:56 PM - Chris Bro: We can do either one.
10/15/23, 1:00 AM - Mogey: Has Lori weighed in?
10/15/23, 1:00 AM - Mogey: Mares wants me to buy it tonight but I gotta know which I’m doing
10/15/23, 1:03 AM - Mogey: Also how many from Alarcon and Chris Dixon families would be attending? I assume whole families from everyone else for sure?
10/15/23, 1:09 AM - Mindy Montgomery-Dixon: Where are you looking?  In the valley?
10/15/23, 1:10 AM - Mogey: The house we found is in Gilbert
10/15/23, 1:10 AM - Mogey: It has tons of amenities
10/15/23, 1:10 AM - Mogey: Book this one

https://www.vrbo.com/3061732
10/15/23, 1:18 AM - Mogey: I just booked it through the 2nd. If we need to change it, we can through November 15.
10/15/23, 1:18 AM - Mindy Montgomery-Dixon: What's the price?
10/15/23, 1:24 AM - Mogey: Right now a 7 family split is $341 per person assuming mom&dale, Lori, Chris, Mason, MaryAnn, Morgan, and Eric families are coming. Charly and Estevan can either count with Alarcon’s or add in to that breakdown?
10/15/23, 1:24 AM - Mogey: That’s for the whole trip per family by the way.
10/15/23, 1:26 AM - Mogey: I’d also be willing to take on say… Julian’s or Mindy’s lodging costs if they want to take on food prep??
10/15/23, 1:36 AM - Mogey: Just to clarify. $341 is the total for the whole trip per family not per person.
10/15/23, 1:49 AM - Chris Bro: Cost Sounds pretty reasonable. I would consider doing the food if Morgan would cover our family’s cost. Would people be Ok with cereal for most of the meals? Although I notice Morgan didn’t list me as a potential person to take on the food job so maybe that’s not on the table.
10/15/23, 1:51 AM - Chris Bro: All of our family should be there including Ben and Grace although it’s always possible they may not be able to make it.
10/15/23, 3:11 AM - Mindy Montgomery-Dixon: I never mind doing the food!  That honestly doesn't stress me out at all.
10/17/23, 12:03 AM - Modge Podge: Dale broke the bones right above his left ankle coming off his ladder too soon this afternoon. We are in the Showlow hospital waiting for his surgery time. The doctor says he may have this and another more complex surgery in 3 or 4 weeks followed by a 3 month healing recovery time. Think of him in your prayers. Love you all ❣️
10/17/23, 12:08 AM - Corey Lowe: Morgan and I will for sure! And let us know if you need anything at all:) Hoping he heals quickly!
10/17/23, 12:09 AM - Mogey: So sorry Dale!
10/17/23, 12:10 AM - Mase: Dale will be in our prayers! So sorry he had a bit of bad luck
10/17/23, 12:14 AM - Lori Alarcon: So sorry to hear! Prayers and good energy for his recovery🙏
10/17/23, 12:42 AM - Mares Eatoats: Oh my goodness!! I’m so sorry!! We will keep him in our prayers for sure
10/17/23, 12:45 AM - Mindy Montgomery-Dixon: That's going to be hard for him to be done for the next few months.  So sorry for his bad luck.  Prayers are being sent your way.  Love you guys!
10/17/23, 12:59 AM - Chris Bro: So sorry to hear. Our thoughts and prayers are with him
10/20/23, 8:25 PM - Lori Alarcon: Weighing in on the house rental situation-don’t count us in on the split. We would love to come up and visit but most likely it wouldn’t be until Monday January 1st (one of Julians regular days off) and it might be just a day trip. He and Cortez and possibly Denali if he gets a job at In and Out will be working that weekend. Charly and Estevan already have plans to be up in the Phoenix area that weekend for a concert they will be attending but I believe they have other arrangements to stay already. They will most likely try and visit sometime while they are up there. If we are able to come see you guys on Monday 1/1 and share meals with you guys we will chip in for that and I’m sure Julian would be happy to help prepare. We will know more specifics of our plan closer to the date. Because our plans are not concrete, plan meal prep and splits without us in the equation. Q? Is the price Morgan quoted inclusive of food to feed everyone(30ish people)all the days you are there or just cost of renting the house only?
10/21/23, 10:37 PM - Charly Alarcon: yes duh me and estevan will be visiting 😆
10/21/23, 10:39 PM - Charly Alarcon: I am starting my first official teaching job in a month! 😄😄 if anyone is interested I made an Amazon wishlist for school supplies!
10/21/23, 10:39 PM - Charly Alarcon: https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/2AWM2U9WTB1EB?ref_=wl_share
10/21/23, 10:45 PM - Mares Eatoats: That’s what we like to hear!! And there’s plenty of space for you too
10/21/23, 10:56 PM - Mares Eatoats: And Lori and crew we look forward to seeing if all works out well!
10/21/23, 11:01 PM - Mares Eatoats: Mindy if you’re cool with food organization and prep we’ll all pay for the Dixon portion of the house. Sorry Chris Mindy’s meals are way too good that we’ll need to pass on your cereal idea. We’ll all still be your sous chefs and split the cost of food too
10/21/23, 11:04 PM - Mogey: Yes just tell us the cost. Does anyone want to be in charge of coming up with some activities kinda like our jeopardy game from last time?
10/21/23, 11:48 PM - Mares Eatoats: I volunteer Eric
10/22/23, 1:02 AM - Eric Dixon: I volunteer not Eric
10/22/23, 1:05 AM - Mares Eatoats: Too late you’ve already been volunteered
10/22/23, 2:39 AM - Mogey: I second that nomination
10/22/23, 2:40 AM - Mares Eatoats: Looks like he’s outvoted
10/22/23, 10:45 AM - Eric Dixon: My jeopardy will consist of one category : home life during Eric's high school years. You guys are gonna love it
10/22/23, 6:12 PM - Mares Eatoats: I already know all the answers to that jeopardy: volleyball, Steve and moms favorite child
10/22/23, 6:15 PM - Corey Lowe: Starting a fire and saying bomb in the airport
10/22/23, 7:01 PM - Lori Alarcon: Sitting on moms lap at age 12
10/22/23, 7:48 PM - Mogey: How about everyone submits 5-10 Dixon jeopardy questions and Eric just has to categorize them and put it together ?
10/22/23, 7:57 PM - Mares Eatoats: I think Eric should make a version of guesstures Dixon edition
10/22/23, 9:43 PM - Eric Dixon: I was sitting on Mom's lap until age 15 (Lori get your facts straight 🙄). There were multiple fires (actually true) and it wasn't just high school that I was/am moms favorite child (also true).
10/22/23, 9:46 PM - Eric Dixon: Guesstures Dixon edition sounds interesting. But how would one act out spumoni?
10/22/23, 9:55 PM - Mogey: That’s for Corey to figure out and Lori to guess
10/22/23, 10:01 PM - Corey Lowe: <Media omitted>
10/25/23, 10:11 PM - Eric Dixon: If anybody has been reading/watching the news, we are currently safe and sheltering in place at the church in Auburn :https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/live-blog/rcna122249&ved=2ahUKEwjD8-eL0ZKCAxVPF1kFHVcnA4IQr_oDKAB6BAgNEAE&usg=AOvVaw0JqcgEOoMRTQ4OrmhZ_8cC
10/25/23, 10:14 PM - Mase: Dang man! That is nuts! How are you guys doing?
10/25/23, 10:15 PM - Corey Lowe: Stay safe buddy! Love you guys!
10/25/23, 10:15 PM - Lori Alarcon: This is the first I’ve heard-so scary and awful!
Stay safe and we will be praying for you and residents of Maine and for the apprehension  of the shooter
❤️u
10/25/23, 10:16 PM - Mogey: Oh my gosh! So they haven’t caught him yet??
10/25/23, 10:16 PM - Chris Bro: That’s terrible 😢 grateful you guys are safe. Echoing Lori’s sentiments on prayer
10/25/23, 10:16 PM - Mogey: Hopefully you were far enough away to not hear any shots fired??
10/25/23, 10:16 PM - Eric Dixon: Doing good. We were just decorating with the youth for trunk or treat when it all started. It's kind of insane
10/25/23, 10:17 PM - Eric Dixon: We did not hear any shots fired
10/25/23, 10:19 PM - Eric Dixon: No he is still at large, but I think heading away from us. (If it is just one guy)

10/25/23, 11:20 PM - Erin Wifey: Not sure yet. Might crash with friends or we might take an out of the way route to my parent's.
10/26/23, 12:25 AM - Erin Wifey: We made it to my parent's house safely

- Dec. 16 arrive and stay at morgs 
- Dec. 17 drive back up to snowflake with Mason and Mindy
- Dec 20/21 drive back down to The Valley and stay with Morg 
- Dec 27 go to Tucson
- Dec 30 drive back to Phoenix for New Year’s Eve festivities
11/24/23, 6:32 PM - Mares Eatoats: Let me know if that works for you all
11/24/23, 7:08 PM - Lori Alarcon: Yes’m🎄
11/24/23, 7:14 PM - Mogey: Yep
11/24/23, 7:14 PM - Mase: Sure does

11/24/23, 7:44 PM - Mares Eatoats: Eric what are your dates again?
11/25/23, 9:21 PM - Eric Dixon: We fly into Phoenix on the 28th and fly out on the 4th
11/25/23, 11:04 PM - Chris Bro: Hey Mares and Eric. We are excited for you both to be in AZ this holiday season! Mares, by Tucson, I am assuming you mean Tucson/Sahuarita? We would love to have you spend some time at our house while you are in AZ. However, as Andrea and I are celebrating our anniversary, we will be out of town ~ Dec 27-29. Is it possible to rearrange the schedule to come to Tucson/ Sahuarita during a different part of your time here (that would also work for the Alarcon family?) 
Eric and Erin, are you guys planning to come down to Tucson/ Sahuarita while you are in AZ?
11/25/23, 11:30 PM - Mares Eatoats: Ahhh gotcha…ok let me see what I can figure out. When is everyone’s kids out for winter break? Lori told me hers are out on the 21st? Is everyone else the same
11/25/23, 11:53 PM - Chris Bro: Jed is out Dec 15-Jan 5.  Isa and Annie Dec 22-Jan 5. I’m off work Dec 23-Jan 5
11/26/23, 9:09 AM - Eric Dixon: Since we are there for such a short time, we are planning on sticking around Phoenix. We are tentatively planning on coming back for a longer period though in a couple months
11/26/23, 1:23 PM - Modge Podge: 👏👏👏👏👏❣️💕
11/26/23, 4:49 PM - Mogey: What time do you fly in Eric?
11/26/23, 5:11 PM - Eric Dixon: Around 1pm. Are you going to be able to pick us up? 🙏

11/27/23, 12:08 PM - Lori Alarcon: Eric LOVE the AI creations(not abominations)❤️❤️
11/27/23, 12:09 PM - Eric Dixon: True, its more like little kid interpretations 😆
11/27/23, 12:11 PM - Eric Dixon: The depiction of Chris is pretty spot on though
11/27/23, 12:31 PM - Modge Podge: 😂 Great birthday card!!! 💕
11/27/23, 12:31 PM - Modge Podge: Happy Birthday Chris ❤️🎂🎉👏
11/27/23, 1:30 PM - Corey Lowe: Happy Birthday Chris!
11/27/23, 1:46 PM - Chris Bro: Thanks for the birthday wishes everyone! Eric, the AI is very entertaining. Love  the references to boggle, basketball, chess (with the pieces set up in an arrangement you would never see in an actual game), the AZ Tigers (Tiger Down Arizona) and the youthful appearance of my doctor avatar. Trying to figure out the significance of the banner and object beneath it as well as the voodoo needle, and the bottle of 20B 🤣
11/27/23, 3:01 PM - Eric Dixon: Haha, I didn't even notice the voodoo needle! Yeah, it sometimes tries to adlib some additional things to the image, so I have no idea what they represent
11/27/23, 3:04 PM - Mogey: I like the girl’s massive forearm in the boggle box picture.
12/9/23, 3:41 PM - Mogey: https://www.facebook.com/100063821679792/posts/pfbid032zUzittQDyg58JXaL2DMiMy7GNEjnqA9NZMxL3HX6fNZWgvbbn2sSm2VYJuiCMpfl/
12/9/23, 3:41 PM - Mogey: A friend told me to go see this movie and I immediately thought of Julian. Is this his movie??
12/9/23, 4:35 PM - Corey Lowe: <Media omitted>
12/9/23, 4:54 PM - Lori Alarcon: I don’t think so- it was my understanding that his scenes were for Book of Mormon videos not a movie?
12/9/23, 4:55 PM - Corey Lowe: Yeah Norgan, don’t rush to conclusions! And I totally meant to say Norgan!!
12/9/23, 6:01 PM - Corey Lowe: <Media omitted>
12/9/23, 6:26 PM - Chris Bro: I was not at the game today.
12/9/23, 6:27 PM - Chris Bro: Ben and I are at Eastern Arizona college right now. They offered him the opportunity to audition for a theater scholarship. I am actually waiting outside right now while he auditions. We’ll see how it goes.
Andrea went to the U of a game with her friend. I just saw the final score. They absolutely destroyed Wisconsin.
12/9/23, 6:28 PM - Mase: That is cool, I hope Ben gets the scholarship!!!
12/9/23, 6:29 PM - Mares Eatoats: Let us know how it goes!
12/9/23, 6:29 PM - Corey Lowe: That’s so awesome for Ben!
12/9/23, 6:39 PM - Eric Dixon: I watched the game today. It was an epic beat down. So fun to watch
12/9/23, 6:39 PM - Eric Dixon: And good luck Ben! 🤞
12/9/23, 6:43 PM - Chris Bro: Especially with the history of Wisconsin beating us in the Elite Eight in back to back years with Frank Kaminski as well as beating us in March madness  many years ago when we had Richard Jefferson and Gilbert Arenas and we were a #1 seed and they were an 8. Great to get such a convincing victory today and make it clear that we are a legit # 1
12/9/23, 6:44 PM - Chris Bro: Thanks for all the well wishes for Ben. Will let you know how it goes.
12/9/23, 6:50 PM - Lori Alarcon: Good luck to Ben!!
12/9/23, 6:52 PM - Eric Dixon: Yup! I thought the same thing. The most points Wisconsin has let a team get since 1995
12/9/23, 6:56 PM - Modge Podge: Yay for Ben- going for it!
12/9/23, 6:58 PM - Modge Podge: Wyatt! The Cold Plunge 🥶 I plunged into glacier water once - never again!
12/9/23, 9:06 PM - Chris Bro: Ben’s audition went well and he has been offered a full tuition scholarship to EAC!

12/19/23, 10:20 PM - Mares Eatoats: Thoughts??
12/19/23, 10:23 PM - Chris Bro: I think that is a good idea
12/19/23, 10:52 PM - Mogey: Yes!
12/19/23, 11:21 PM - Mindy Montgomery-Dixon: We definitely need a new group pic of us all!

1/2/24, 1:28 AM - Lori Alarcon: Does anyone see a sun glass lens laying around? When we got back to the hotel, I noticed one was missing on my sun glasses🤷‍♀️
1/2/24, 1:29 AM - Corey Lowe: Hmmm
1/2/24, 1:29 AM - Corey Lowe: We have not yet
1/2/24, 1:31 AM - Lori Alarcon: My stuff was over on that ledge by the front door
1/2/24, 1:31 AM - Corey Lowe: Will do
1/2/24, 1:33 AM - Mogey: I did see them by the window sill where you were cleaning out your bag earlier. I will check if it is still there
1/2/24, 3:39 AM - Mogey: Your lens is still here
1/2/24, 12:30 PM - Lori Alarcon: Ok we are going to swing by around 11a to the house to get the lens. If we aren’t there when everyone leaves can someone leave the lens in a baggie on the front porch?
1/2/24, 12:43 PM - Mase: The lens is on the ledge just to the left of the front door
1/2/24, 12:44 PM - Lori Alarcon: 👌😊

1/4/24, 6:09 PM - Lori Alarcon: Ditto to what Eric said!
It was lovely seeing everyone and we had a great time playing badminton tournaments, ping pong, pickleball, and can jam.
*We discovered a sibling plays dirty in pickleball -any guesses?😂💪
1/4/24, 6:09 PM - Mogey: Glad you made it half way! Drive safe! So sad you’re gone already
1/4/24, 6:13 PM - Chris Bro: Great seeing everyone. Gandalf, glad you and your fam made it back safely. Safe travels to Merry and her family. My guess to Lori’s question is Lori herself
1/4/24, 6:13 PM - Lori Alarcon: Your guess is incorrect
1/4/24, 6:15 PM - Lori Alarcon: Who’s Merry? It would seem you are also referencing Lord of  the Rings/Hobbit

1/4/24, 6:22 PM - Modge Podge: It was A WONDERFUL NEW YEARS EVENT ❣️❣️❣️❣️💕💕 Definitely looking forward to the next get together 👏👏👏😃
1/4/24, 6:31 PM - Eric Dixon: Merry Ann Pippin of course 😛
1/4/24, 7:43 PM - Corey Lowe: Glad everyone was able to stay here! It feels weird already with everyone gone! It was a lot of fun everyone:) The Abyss next time you’re all here? 😜
1/4/24, 8:43 PM - Mase: It was a ton of fun hanging with the Dixon Clan!! There were lots of games, lots of food, loads of laughing, some crying(sorry probably my littles), moments of chaos, tempered by silence only when all were asleep. Overall 5 stars, would absolutely do it again😄!!!!
1/4/24, 9:00 PM - Mares Eatoats: Thanks Corey and Morgan for basically hosting us all for almost 2 weeks straight! Loved every second of being with you all. The wins and the losses in all the fun games were a great time. This merry Ann learned from the best in pickle ball
1/4/24, 9:02 PM - Mares Eatoats: I’d say now’s the perfect time for the abyss in complete silence except for Morgan’s snores as we know she’ll fall asleep from boredom minutes in
1/4/24, 9:03 PM - Mase: Anyone down to play Splendor?🤣
1/4/24, 9:04 PM - Corey Lowe: Splendid idea!
1/4/24, 9:04 PM - Mogey: I’m in!
1/4/24, 9:05 PM - Mares Eatoats: In!
1/4/24, 9:26 PM - Modge Podge: Where are you now, MaryAnn???
1/4/24, 9:45 PM - Mares Eatoats: Somewhere over the ocean
1/4/24, 9:49 PM - Corey Lowe: How’s the turbulence?
1/4/24, 9:51 PM - Mogey: Ok mares, you weren’t wrong about tea pigs. That was amazing
1/4/24, 10:05 PM - Modge Podge: Yes, that tea is maybe the best tea ever! Has licorice in it, I think? Which doesn't work for blood pressure 😕. But ...Hong Kong barley tea... Great!!! And all around healthy 😀
1/4/24, 10:24 PM - Mares Eatoats: I know right! And it’s perfect just as it is without adding anything to it!
1/4/24, 10:25 PM - Erin Wifey: Darn I missed trying it! I'll have to order some too, it sounds delicious
1/5/24, 8:56 AM - Mares Eatoats: We finally made it home!

1/5/24, 8:30 PM - Mares Eatoats: Just a reminder for those who were staying at the house that food is $33 per person in your family. Make sure to send that over to Mason and Mindy this weekend if you haven’t already. Love you all! Thanks for being an amazing family.

1/7/24, 8:19 PM - Eric Dixon: I don't know Lori, you're pretty good at misdirection too. Julian thought you were going to hit the frisbee into that can every time it flew over the top in kanjam 😂
1/7/24, 8:19 PM - Lori Alarcon: Right…🫵
1/7/24, 8:36 PM - Mares Eatoats: You just gave Lori way too much credit in her kan jam abilities
1/7/24, 8:37 PM - Lori Alarcon: This is a rare case I agree with Mary Ann….
1/7/24, 8:43 PM - Modge Podge: Great birthday card, Eric 👏👏👏😂 Thank you ❣️

2/18/24, 12:09 PM - Chris Bro: Isabella is turning 18 in a month. It was very meaningful for Grace to get all of your messages of love and encouragement as she entered adulthood on her 18th birthday. We want to do something similar for Isa. She puts a lot of love out into the world, usually unnoticed, she prays every night for every single member of her extended family by name. All her cousins, Aunts, Uncles, everyone. As a middle child she often feels forgotten and left out. We want her 18th birthday to be special, so she feels special. What we are asking is for you to each compose a written message  for her with words of encouragement, positive things about her, and if you would like, advice on entering adulthood. You could send a handwritten card if you want, but a text is fine too. Andrea is going to compile them all and scrapbook them somehow into one book that she can have to read anytime she is feeling overwhelmed, discouraged, or just needs to feel extra love.
Her birthday is March 16, but if you could try to send it by the first weekend in March so Andrea has time to put the book together. Could you also invite your kids to write or draw something because we think she would even love drawings from the little ones. The more messages the better. If it's easier to email, andreadixon611@gmail.com
Text is fine too. If you send a card, address it to Andrea NOT Isa so we don't accidentally spoil the surprise. 709 W Via de Gala, Sahuarita AZ 85629
As far as her future plans, currently she is planning to go to BYU-I for a year and then go on a mission, and then finish up at BYU-Provo getting a degree in Human Resources Management.
2/18/24, 12:29 PM - Mase: We can definitely help out with that!
2/18/24, 12:38 PM - Eric Dixon: That's awesome, for sure we can also
2/19/24, 2:55 PM - Mogey: <Media omitted>
2/19/24, 2:56 PM - Modge Podge: How bout that! Looks good!
2/19/24, 2:59 PM - Modge Podge: And Yes! Very glad to write great things about Isa ❣️❣️❣️
2/19/24, 3:00 PM - Chris Bro: Thank you Mom! And everyone else!
2/23/24, 2:47 AM - Mares Eatoats: FYI just bought my flight to come back for Charlys wedding! Can’t wait to see everyone!
2/23/24, 8:11 AM - Mares Eatoats: Axel would be proud
2/23/24, 8:12 AM - Mares Eatoats: Same! I’ll get that to you sometime at the end of next week
2/26/24, 5:27 PM - Mares Eatoats: <Media omitted>
2/26/24, 5:33 PM - Eric Dixon: Yup! Sounds like the cheap tickets are like 250
2/26/24, 5:34 PM - Chris Bro: Final four and championship game will be in PHX area this year at the Cardinals stadium! Final four is April 6 (same day as Charly’s wedding). I am planning to go to the championship game on Monday April 8. Hoping the Wildcats will be there as well. They are currently #6 in the country and considered likely to be a #1 or #2 seed. 
Anyone else interested in going to the championship game? Eric is right on cost of tickets.
2/26/24, 5:37 PM - Chris Bro: Also just a reminder about the request for Isa’s birthday if you haven’t yet sent anything. I will repost the original message:

9/28/24, 11:43 AM - Chris Bro: Ben and I just got back from a beautiful trip to Argentina for the dedication of the Mendoza Argentina temple and to visit families that I taught as a missionary and have stayed in contact with over the years.
9/28/24, 11:58 AM - Mares Eatoats: Que rico!!! Y que suerte estar allí!
9/28/24, 12:01 PM - Chris Bro: ¡Sí, el asado salió riquísimo! Me imagino que el padre de Damián te haya preparado un asado Argentino en algunas ocasiones.
9/28/24, 12:02 PM - Chris Bro: No me acuerdo, ¿de que parte de Argentina es Damián?
9/28/24, 12:03 PM - Mares Eatoats: No diría que lo ha hecho así! Eso parece muucho mejor!
9/28/24, 12:03 PM - Mares Eatoats: Buenos Aires
9/28/24, 12:05 PM - Damian K Y: Espero que hayas disfrutando de un buen asado de mi parte.
9/28/24, 12:06 PM - Damian K Y: La boca Buenos Aires
9/28/24, 12:11 PM - Chris Bro: ¿De allí sale el nombre del equipo de fútbol? ¿Así que sos de Boca?
9/28/24, 12:12 PM - Chris Bro: No solo uno, pero 2 asados buenísimos
9/28/24, 1:15 PM - Mogey: That is really cool Chris! Looks like you guys loved every minute!
9/28/24, 2:48 PM - Chris Bro: We did, other than Ben consumed a huge quantity of asado and felt sick for about 24 hours. (He said it was worth it and would eat asado again if he had the chance. He was able to recover and eat another asado later in the week.)
9/28/24, 3:04 PM - Lori Alarcon: ❤️❤️
9/28/24, 4:33 PM - Modge Podge: What a wonderful experience you two had ❣️ Were any of the people you visited the ones that held church meetings in their home after they were baptized???
9/28/24, 4:36 PM - Chris Bro: Yes
9/28/24, 5:00 PM - Modge Podge: Which picture??
9/28/24, 5:02 PM - Chris Bro: 2 different families held meetings in their home over the years. I will send a picture of each.
9/28/24, 5:02 PM - Mindy Montgomery-Dixon: What a fun experience!

9/28/24, 5:03 PM - Chris Bro: <Media omitted>
9/28/24, 5:04 PM - Chris Bro: There is now an official chapel in Ugarteche where these families are from.
9/28/24, 5:06 PM - Modge Podge: Is one of these families the one who lost their daughter, and at first was not willing to let you talk to them??
9/28/24, 5:08 PM - Modge Podge: Those two families are amazing for being willing to have church meetings in their home every Sunday ❣️
9/28/24, 5:24 PM - Chris Bro: The Aballay family’s daughter died at some point before they met me. Their previous Christian church told them it was because they did not have enough faith so they stopped attending any church. The Aballay family was  not ever unwilling to talk to us just hesitant at first. Although you may be remembering their son Hernán who was in his mid twenties at the time and was unwilling to talk to us until my companion challenged him to arm wrestle.
9/28/24, 5:27 PM - Chris Bro: Sadly the Aballay family has not been active for a number of years although they received a visit very well from Ben and I as well as Cristina (daughter of the Miranda family) and invited us back for an asado later in the week. We had some positive conversations with them and I am hopeful.

10/1/24, 7:55 PM - Modge Podge: Gene just texted. Wes just got taken to the hospital - may be a stroke!
10/1/24, 7:55 PM - Modge Podge: Keep them in your prayers ❣️
10/1/24, 8:01 PM - Lori Alarcon: So sorry to hear and yes definitely in our prayers🙏❤️
10/1/24, 8:02 PM - Chris Bro: He will definitely be in our prayers. Please keep us updated.
10/1/24, 8:06 PM - Mares Eatoats: Oh no. We will definitely keep him in our prayers. Hope he will be ok
10/1/24, 8:07 PM - Mogey: Oh no! I’m sorry. I will pray for Wes and the Warren family!💕 Tell Gene we are all thinking of them
10/1/24, 8:55 PM - Mindy Montgomery-Dixon: That's awful!  We will be praying for them all.  Keep us posted on what's happening.
10/1/24, 9:09 PM - Mase: That is terrible!! Hope he is okay and we'll keep him in our prayers.
10/1/24, 11:02 PM - Chris Bro: Mom, any updates on how Wes is doing?
10/1/24, 11:49 PM - Modge Podge: Per Gene, since he is still in ICU, visiting hours end at 8, and everyone who is not a patient has to leave until 5 am. But Wes is recovering his motor skills and memory really well and seems to be doing much better. Tomorrow they're going to try to figure out what happened. Gene laid down the law that for the time being he CANNOT talk about politics!
10/2/24, 12:55 PM - Modge Podge: Good morning..he's doing great, very tired tho. They did assessments all night so was waking him up every hour after midnight. There's no visible trace in his speech that he had a stroke at all. Soon the neurologist will be in and later he'll have an MRI for heart and brain to see what happened.
10/2/24, 12:55 PM - Modge Podge: Per Gene 😀
10/2/24, 3:02 PM - Chris Bro: Good to hear. Thanks for the update, Mom!
10/2/24, 10:32 PM - Modge Podge: <Media omitted>
10/2/24, 10:32 PM - Modge Podge: The dr just came in. She says nothing concerning was found in the Echo. So the stroke didn’t come from his heart. His cholesterol is pretty high, and the MRI didn’t show anything narrowing of his arteries so that’s good. They are thinking the stroke came from plaque break off that went into his brain which originated from his high cholesterol. They are going to start him on some statin drugs to address the cholesterol and some medication that will keep his blood slightly thinner. The likelihood of him having another stroke is kind of high for the next month, so the statin drugs are super important. The dr said he should be able to go home tomorrow if everything continues the way that it’s been all day. They are going to get him up to walk at 5:00
10/2/24, 10:33 PM - Modge Podge: Per Gene about 4 pm
10/2/24, 11:04 PM - Mindy Montgomery-Dixon: Thanks for keeping us updated!  Glad he seems to be ok.
10/2/24, 11:13 PM - Mares Eatoats: Thanks mom! I hope the family is holding up ok
10/2/24, 11:44 PM - Lori Alarcon: Sounds like things are moving forward!
10/3/24, 1:28 PM - Chris Bro: <Media omitted>
10/3/24, 1:29 PM - Chris Bro: Saw this while driving to work today. Brought back lots of memories. Anyone recognize?
10/3/24, 1:35 PM - Mares Eatoats: Give Morgan a chance to crawl underneath it and I think her memories will come flooding back
10/3/24, 2:48 PM - Modge Podge: Well...the neurologist came in this morning and the MRI showed no stroke. 👏
So soon after the doctor came in she pretty much said what the neurologist said. Wes was dehydrated plus blood sugar was high plus not eating anything up to the "event"  can cause mental confusion/slurred speech, weakness and light headed ness.
His cholesterol still needs addressed with a statin drug and he needs to take a baby aspirin (for keeping the platelets slick)everyday plus work on the way we eat to correct the diabetes. 
Still if this happens again do the same as we did for this because with everything that he has he would still be at risk of a stroke. The symptoms that he was having mimic a stroke. 
We're very happy to hear all this news but know it's a wake up call to do some things differently. No more skipping breakfast and lunch! Eat more regularly with a diabetic meal plan in mind, drink more water regularly, exercise and on and on.
Wes is very thankful it wasn't an actual stroke for lots of reasons but this won't affect him having a pilots license 👏👏 (that's a real hassle)
So we'll be checking out soon and headed home. He's still pretty tired and is snoring away right now 😴
Thank you for all your prayers!!! They were answered!!🙏🏼
10/3/24, 2:48 PM - Modge Podge: Per Gene 😀
10/3/24, 2:56 PM - Lori Alarcon: Good news!
10/3/24, 3:13 PM - Mase: Loved our old dolphin!!
10/3/24, 4:11 PM - Chris Bro: Great to hear about Wes doing better. Thanks for the update Mom!

10/21/24, 4:57 AM - Damian K Y: Hey! Thanks. Is not exactly a restaurant, is homemade food to go. But yes, is going well so far, is a well known place in the area. People already know the food there and we are maintaining the same style and quality, in fact we are still working with the same cook that was working with the previous owners.

11/16/24, 7:55 AM - Mindy Montgomery-Dixon: Sorry it's so late, but I'm in the ER with Mason right now and he could really use your prayers.  He has been sick since Sun night. Mon and Tues was fever and chills and body aches, then Tues night his fever broke and his throat started hurting.  His throat everyday has gotten worse and he has had low energy.  He finally went to the doctor today and they ruled out strep, but said his throat is really swollen.  They gave him pain pills and amoxicillin.  I worked all day and then went to a play my friends kids is in and when I got home at 11 he seemed real bad.  So I called up Eric and our doc friend Brett and had them come over to give him a blessing.  Brett looked at his throat again and insisted we go straight to the ER. In the 6 hrs since Brett had seen Mason in his office, his throat was more swollen and on his left side and his uvula is pushed to the side.  It looks like it's  an abscess. I took him to the ER and they found 2 absences that are extremely big. We don't have any ear throat doc up here so they are sending us to the valley. He just got on a helicopter to be flown down to banner PHX UMC.  I'm just leaving Showlow to drive down.  I will update when I get there.
11/16/24, 9:02 AM - Chris Bro: Thanks for letting us know Mindy. Will be praying. Going to temple this morning and will put his name on prayer list as well. Is it your husband or little Mason?
11/16/24, 9:19 AM - Mindy Montgomery-Dixon: It's my husband!  I guess I should have clarified that!
11/16/24, 9:51 AM - Corey Lowe: Minds, let us know if there’s anything we can do since we’re close by. I put Mason’s name on the prayer roll via the Tools app. Everyone can use that if they can’t make it to the temple.
11/16/24, 10:02 AM - Lori Alarcon: Oh Goodness! Prayers for Mason🙏❤️❤️
11/16/24, 11:29 AM - Mogey: Oh no! Definitely praying for him. A co worker of mine had that exact description and was sick for a couple weeks. The swollen abscess thing was on the tail end of the sickness as well. She is a couple days in to treating that. So scary. Please update us as soon as you can. I can meet you, Mindy if you want company or help getting you food or whatever. Let us know when you’ve arrived and how he’s doing
11/16/24, 12:06 PM - Mindy Montgomery-Dixon: I got to the hospital about 830.  Mason is doing much better and is just sleeping now.  We are waiting for the ENT doc to come see him to find out the next step.  Thanks for the prayers and love!
11/16/24, 1:03 PM - Mindy Montgomery-Dixon: Thanks!  So the ENT doc just came in.  He says he doesn't see any absences, just lots of swelling.  So no surgery or draining happening.  Since he is doing better, they are just going to keep monitoring him and giving him steroids to see if the swelling goes down.  He said we are staying the night and will see how tomorrow looks.
11/16/24, 2:14 PM - Chris Bro: Thanks for the update, Mindy! Good to hear. Will continue to keep him in our prayers. Please continue to keep us updated.
11/16/24, 10:47 PM - Corey Lowe: <Media omitted>
11/17/24, 1:31 PM - Mogey: How’s Mace today?
11/17/24, 2:50 PM - Mindy Montgomery-Dixon: Update for Mason, he is doing really good now, but they are keeping him another day still.  His throat still has swelling, but it is going down. Because of his steroids though he now has high sugars and acid reflux which keeps giving him hiccups which he hates.  😂 We should be released tomorrow though.
11/17/24, 3:26 PM - Chris Bro: Thanks for the update. Good to hear (about the improvement and release tomorrow, not the hiccups, acid reflux and high sugars)

11/18/24, 9:05 PM - Mindy Montgomery-Dixon: Update: We are still at the hospital!  They have been waiting since 10 this morning to get another MRI done.  If everything looks good then they will release him.  But they just took him back and the doc won't be able to look at it until the morning, so we are stuck here another night.
11/18/24, 10:17 PM - Chris Bro: Thanks for the update Mindy. You said it in an earlier text that the ENT doc did not think that he had an abscess. Did they have any idea what caused the swelling?
11/19/24, 9:45 AM - Chris Bro: Happy birthday, Lori! Hope you are having an amazing 50th!

11/25/24, 12:10 AM - Chris Bro: Thanks for sharing that Scouter! My daughter Annie helped me to write the words for that and we had a special experience doing that together. I miss Dad playing the guitar. As I listened to the recording, I can see that my guitar skill is definitely nowhere hear his level. 
I’m grateful that Kent Thompson recorded him  playing a few of his songs.  I ran into one of his sons recently and was letting that son know how grateful I was for his dad recording our dad’s music. 
Love you guys and look forward to seeing many of you on Thanksgiving  in a few days.

12/1/24, 12:22 PM - Chris Bro: We are looking forward to seeing you and your family, Mares! Still sad that you are not coming to Sahuarita during your 3 weeks in the US 😢 but if you change your mind, let us know. 
Here are our plans for Christmas week:
-Sunday Dec 22-Monday Dec 23. We will get a hotel close to Morgan’s house so we can hang out on those 2 days with the Lowes, Sayaz family and whoever else will be there. 
-Tuesday and Wednesday Dec 24-25 we will be at home in Sahuarita
-Thursday-Sat Dec 26-28 we will get a hotel in Mission Bay/ San Diego near where the Alarcon family is staying so we can hang out with the Alarcon, Lowe, and Sayaz family and anyone else who may be coming. 
Alarcon, Lowe, & Sayaz families, please correct me if any if the above is inaccurate regarding where you will be on those dates. 
Mason &Mindy, Eric & Erin, Mom & Dale, are you planning to be in PHX area Dec 22-23 and/or SanDiego Dec 26-28?
12/1/24, 12:31 PM - Mogey: How about our family hosts a Christmas-y dinner on the 22nd? If everyone chips in, I’d be down to do a prime rib?
12/1/24, 12:32 PM - Chris Bro: Sounds like a great plan Scouter! We are happy to chip in and bring sides
12/1/24, 4:09 PM - Modge Podge: We're in - ok to have dinner in the 3-4 o'clock range?
12/1/24, 4:24 PM - Mogey: Yep! I’ll try to keep it around between 2-3 actually. That way Alarcons might be able to sneak up without it being too late before they head out to California the next day? (You’re always welcome to stay the night as a pit stop on your way😉)
12/1/24, 4:26 PM - Mogey: Mason/Mindy and Eric/Erin let me know when you know if you can come so I know how much meat to buy :)

12/4/24, 4:37 PM - Chris Bro: Congratulations Aria and Mason! 
I loved competing in the spelling bee back in my day. I can’t remember any of the words that I got right, but I still remember the words that knocked me out of the county and state spelling bees:
peon, macabre, and disanimate
12/4/24, 5:11 PM - Lori Alarcon: Congrats Aria! So fun!! You are joining the ranks of Spelling Bee Champs in the family! I won 2 school spelling bees in elementary school and Demarcco won his school spelling bee in middle school-lost on the word maize at the next level
Chris definitely went the farthest in the spelling world💪🔠
12/4/24, 5:24 PM - Mares Eatoats: Yay!!!! Nice job! Spelling bees are so fun! I do miss those days! I was knocked out with the word psyche at the county spelling bee
12/4/24, 5:45 PM - Corey Lowe: I got knocked out by the word “rock”
12/4/24, 6:13 PM - Mogey: Oh her excited face is super fantastic😍
12/4/24, 6:14 PM - Mares Eatoats: I’m surprised you got that far
12/4/24, 6:15 PM - Mares Eatoats: That really is an adorable video
12/4/24, 6:23 PM - Corey Lowe: Yeah, it wasn’t my favorite way to begin college for sure
12/5/24, 10:13 AM - Modge Podge: Congratulations Aria ❣️❣️❣️ My knockout word was "perseverance" I still have to double check that spelling!
12/7/24, 5:14 PM - Chris Bro: Just a reminder in case anyone would like to attend:

12/11/24, 9:35 PM - Mares Eatoats: Oh just pay me when I get there
12/11/24, 9:35 PM - Mares Eatoats: Those ways only work in Hong Kong
12/11/24, 9:35 PM - Modge Podge: Do you know what the wire is made of??
12/11/24, 9:35 PM - Mares Eatoats: That I’m not sure of
12/11/24, 9:36 PM - Modge Podge: When do you get on a plane???

12/12/24, 7:38 PM - Lori Alarcon: Got it!
12/13/24, 5:34 PM - Mogey: Ok I just placed an order for a 10 pound prime rib. Not sure how many people are planning to come for the Christmas party on Dec 22. But the estimated cost was about $150 for the meat. So probably less than $35/ per family? Does that work for everyone and can I get one more head count of which families are for sure coming?
12/13/24, 6:01 PM - Modge Podge: Dale says "We are in ❣️"
12/13/24, 6:11 PM - Mares Eatoats: We’re in

12/16/24, 3:35 PM - Mogey: We’ll plan to eat about 3ish?
12/16/24, 3:35 PM - Mogey: Lori are you planning to eat with us? Just want an accurate headcount for how much meat we need
12/16/24, 3:36 PM - Chris Bro: 3 pm sounds good to me. We are flexible though on whatever time works best for everyone
12/16/24, 3:40 PM - Lori Alarcon: Yes we are shooting to eat with you guys-it will be either 5 or 7 of us if Charly and Estevan come

1/22/25, 9:42 AM - Mase: Probably take the thicker one
1/22/25, 9:51 AM - Modge Podge: How about the frame - or under bed trundle???

1/26/25, 12:17 PM - Mase: I remember, did you buy it?
1/26/25, 12:34 PM - Mogey: Nah. I looked at the topics and a lot were pretty outdated. But it definitely brought me back to days when Eric had a hint of struggle with his r’s and would ask to play. As soon as I saw it, I could hear it in my memory
1/26/25, 12:59 PM - Mase: That's awesome!
1/26/25, 2:22 PM - Corey Lowe: Yeah
1/26/25, 2:22 PM - Corey Lowe: So awesome!

1/26/25, 6:05 PM - Mase: That's so cool, yes we want to watch
1/26/25, 6:05 PM - Modge Podge: Do you have a link??
1/26/25, 6:06 PM - Mindy Montgomery-Dixon: Can't wait to see where she is going!
1/26/25, 6:06 PM - Mase: My guess is Taiwan
1/26/25, 6:07 PM - Chris Bro: I don’t really know how Facebook works, never having had an account. But I dont think there is a link. I think you just go to her Facebook page and you will be able to join the Facebook live at 4:30.
1/26/25, 6:13 PM - Chris Bro: Good guess Mase! I would love for her to go to Argentina, however my guess is Brazil
1/26/25, 6:14 PM - Chris Bro: Any other guesses?
1/26/25, 6:16 PM - Modge Podge: Or Illinois - somewhere Church historyish 😀
1/26/25, 6:45 PM - Chris Bro: For anyone that didn’t see, she is going to serve in Retalhuleu, Guatemala

1/28/25, 10:47 PM - Chris Bro: In case anyone didnt see Caleb Love’s epic overtime forcing 55 foot buzzer beater against the #3 team in the country in last night’s game at McKale Center that the Wildcats would go on win in overtime, here is a short Facebook video clip that Andrea just shared with me

2/1/25, 11:17 AM - Modge Podge: Wes and Gene plan to leave Idaho on Sunday. ETA here Tuesday or Wednesday. Will be here at least a week, hopefully longer
2/1/25, 2:17 PM - Mase: Sweet!
2/1/25, 2:23 PM - Chris Bro: 👍
2/1/25, 2:23 PM - Chris Bro: Please keep us posted on details
2/1/25, 8:37 PM - Chris Bro: This coming Saturday is pretty full for us but we would love to see Wes and Gene while they are in AZ maybe on Sunday Feb 9. 
Here is an idea if everyone is on board. Since Morgan and Corey’s is the most central location, wondering if you (Morgan and Corey) would be open to hosting a family dinner that afternoon (Sun Feb 9)?
Mom, do you think Wes and Gene would be up for driving down to the Lowe’s that day?
I recognize that it is also Super Bowl Sunday so I don’t know if people already have plans or are willing to modify those plans for that day. 
Please let us know your thoughts
2/2/25, 2:54 PM - Chris Bro: Just following up on the above as I didn’t see a response from anyone.
Morgan and Corey, would you be up for hosting a Sunday afternoon dinner next Sunday, February 9 that Wes and Gene could come to? 
Mom, do you think that Wes and Gene would be open to driving down to the Lowe’s? 
We would also be open to host, but would be a much farther drive  for many people.
2/2/25, 3:48 PM - Modge Podge: Sounds like a great idea. Not sure yet what Wes and Gene will be up for ???
2/2/25, 4:13 PM - Mogey: Let me chat with Corey on that. If it’s Super Bowl Sunday, he often get together with his dad but he will be just getting back from Colorado as well. I will chat with him tonight on it and give you guys a final later. If we don’t host, Sunday in Tucson could work if they’re also wanting to see David?
2/3/25, 11:08 AM - Chris Bro: Happy birthday to our Brother Ben!
2/3/25, 11:08 AM - Chris Bro: <Media omitted>
2/3/25, 11:09 AM - Chris Bro: Y ¡Feliz Cumpleaños a Cortez!

2/3/25, 9:02 PM - Mindy Montgomery-Dixon: Happy birthday Cortez and Ben!
2/3/25, 9:07 PM - Mogey: Love that picture! Yes happy birthday to Ben and Cortez! I was listening to a saved voicemail from dad the other day and it made me wish we had something with Ben’s voice recorded on it. I’m glad we had so many that put their talents to work, including Mares picture of young Ben!💕

I’m sure grateful for this family of mine!
2/3/25, 11:06 PM - Chris Bro: We do have some of the old family videos like Superguy, Dixon Carols, etc. A few years ago, Andrea made the VHS’s into DVD’s and gave them out to each family. I’m not sure if anyone still has them or how many people still even have a DVD player.
2/3/25, 11:16 PM - Mogey: <Media omitted>
2/4/25, 9:20 AM - Mase: Love it
2/4/25, 9:26 AM - Chris Bro: I communicated with Morgan last night and sounds like the Lowe’s will not be able to host this Sunday. 
I definitely want to see Wes and Gene while they are in Arizona. My family and I can drive up to Snowflake this Sunday.  Mason and Mindy or Eric and Erin, would either of you be open to host a Sunday afternoon family dinner?
2/4/25, 12:07 PM - Mindy Montgomery-Dixon: We would totally be willing to host dinner on Sunday!  Would you guys be just coming up for the day?  Or staying the night?
2/4/25, 1:47 PM - Chris Bro: Thanks Mindy! We are looking forward to it. We would just be coming up for the day. Would you like us to bring anything? What time do you guys have church on Sunday?
2/4/25, 2:23 PM - Mindy Montgomery-Dixon: Our church is 9-11, Eric and Erin's is from 1:30-3:30.  So you could drive up and make it to theirs.  I don't know about food yet.  Let me think about that and get back to you.
2/4/25, 2:25 PM - Corey Lowe: Thanks Mindy! You’re the best!
2/6/25, 1:22 PM - Lori Alarcon: We won’t be able to make it this Sunday- give Wes and Gene our best!
2/6/25, 1:24 PM - Mase: Ahh dang, you'll be missed. I'll make sure to give Wes and Gene your worst since you won't be here
2/6/25, 1:30 PM - Lori Alarcon: A predictable Mason thing to say…🤗
2/8/25, 6:39 PM - Mindy Montgomery-Dixon: Ok, tomorrow we will plan on eating early around 4 so that those that are driving home can leave whenever they need to.  We plan on doing a taco bar!
2/8/25, 7:32 PM - Chris Bro: Sounds great. Thanks Mindy! We look forward to seeing everyone
2/9/25, 2:04 PM - Chris Bro: Just giving a quick  update. It will just be Jed and I coming. We are in globe so will arrive in Snowflake about 2pm. We already went to church earlier this morning, so we’ll be coming straight to Mason and Mindy’s. See you soon.
2/9/25, 4:15 PM - Mindy Montgomery-Dixon: Chris and Jed are here!  Anyone is welcome to come early and play games!
2/9/25, 6:25 PM - Corey Lowe: Almost there!

2/12/25, 5:00 PM - Chris Bro: Good job competing Aria! It is great that you are already competing in the county spelling bee at such a young age so you will have quite a few opportunities in the next few years to advance to the next stage.
2/12/25, 9:52 PM - Modge Podge: Yay, Aria ❣️❣️All the reading you do certainly helps you be such a good speller ❣️❣️
2/21/25, 4:32 PM - Chris Bro: https://www.walkersanderson.com/obituaries/Brent-Theurer?obId=37279176
2/21/25, 5:11 PM - Chris Bro: Many of you may remember President Theurer as our stake President in the Rincon Stake. Above is the link to his obituary. Although I never knew him very well, he was the stake president who interviewed me as I was preparing for my mission. 
I still remember clearly a specific part of that interview where he asked what I would do if I was on my mission and started feeling depressed. I responded that I would pray for Help. He asked what I would do if I was praying harder and still feeling depressed. I gave several more Sunday school answers such as reading my scriptures more, etc. He continued to ask what would I do if I was still feeling depressed after doing all of those things. He was very familiar with the circumstances with our dad‘s mental health, and as I understood, he had also struggled with his own mental health. His point and what he emphasize to me was that if I was trying to do all the right things and was still having struggles with mental health that it was important to seek professional help, including Counseling and or taking medication if needed. Although I was blessed on my mission to not have any challenges with mental health, there was a period a few months after my mission where I did begin to feel significant depression and anxiety. I remembered his counsel and ended up going to see a counselor, as well as started treatment with an antidepressant for about a year that made a huge difference for me at that time.    Although I have not needed prescription medication for depression since then, I will always remember his counsel and would not hesitate to seek help again in the future if it was ever needed. 
I am very grateful to have known President  Theurer. My thoughts and prayers are with his family.
2/21/25, 5:28 PM - Mase: I don't remember him very well, but he sounds like an inspired man. Thanks for sharing that with us Chris

4/19/25, 2:27 AM - Mogey: Hey family. It’s looking like we won’t be able to host an Easter dinner as planned. Corey has had a stomach ache over the last week that increased in pain today. We went to the ER and we are now awaiting surgery for appendicitis. He will be in the hospital for the next couple of days it sounds like. Please keep Corey in your prayers for a smooth surgery and swift recovery, if you are awake to do so💕
4/19/25, 2:30 AM - Modge Podge: Definitely in our prayers ❤️
4/19/25, 2:31 AM - Lori Alarcon: Oh goodness!
We will keep Corey in our prayers 
Good energy for the surgery and a speedy recovery ❤️
4/19/25, 2:37 AM - Mindy Montgomery-Dixon: Oh no!  Just added you guys to the snowflake prayer roll and we will be praying as well.  Let us know if you need anything. ❤️
4/19/25, 2:51 AM - Chris Bro: Sorry to hear, Corey. Will keep you in our prayers. Hoping for a speedy recovery.

4/19/25, 7:33 PM - Modge Podge: Thank you Lori and Julian for being there ❣️❣️ And for your lovely encouraging report 😀 Yes, we will continue prayers for him ❣️
4/20/25, 2:36 PM - Mogey: Just spoke with the surgeon. Corey is still too inflamed for the surgeon to do anything. They cleaned him up but did not close. They are telling me he needs to be sedated for a couple more days before they try again. It’s looking like Tuesday morning.
4/20/25, 2:57 PM - Lori Alarcon: ❤️🙏

5/5/25, 1:56 PM - Mogey: Wow that’s really rude Mindy
5/5/25, 2:01 PM - Chris Bro: I’m not offended by your phone’s imperfect rendition of what you intended to say,  Mindy. We look forward to seeing you guys on Sunday!
5/5/25, 2:18 PM - Mindy Montgomery-Dixon: Wouldn't miss it!  😂 Not sure if that was my phone or me!
5/6/25, 5:17 PM - Lori Alarcon: Regrets Alarcon’s likely won’t make it due to previously scheduled conflicts at your sacrament time and after.
All the best to Isa and her upcoming mission to Guatemala!
Will the meeting be zoomed?
If so can you post the link so some of us can try and listen in? ❤️
5/6/25, 5:33 PM - Chris Bro: No worries, Lori. Thanks for letting us know. Unfortunately, our branch does not have a zoom option.
5/6/25, 5:34 PM - Eric Dixon: All 5 of us are planning on heading down Sunday and staying after for lunch
5/7/25, 6:32 AM - Mogey: Isa mentioned to me that she will be speaking in an English ward later the same day? And that it would be available via YouTube? Maybe find that info and post? Lowe-stettler’s are not going to make it.
We are back in the ER tonight for Corey. He has a bowel obstruction. They are hoping it will resolve without surgery and will be monitoring him for the next 24 hours before they do a small bowel follow through In hopes everything returns to normal. We can use the prayers again 😭
5/7/25, 9:40 AM - Mindy Montgomery-Dixon: Oh no!  Sending prayers!
5/7/25, 11:08 AM - Chris Bro: It was probably the spaghetti. Sorry about that Corey. Hope you don’t have to have the NG tube in your nose too long. We’re keeping you in our prayers.
5/7/25, 11:10 AM - Chris Bro: Isa’s English ward talk will be at 12:30 this Sunday May 11 and will be streamed live

5/9/25, 4:40 PM - Eric Dixon: Our mom has a stellar recipe for the liquid form of spaghetti if you're interested
5/9/25, 4:41 PM - Eric Dixon: 🤢
5/9/25, 5:07 PM - Modge Podge: What????! Doesn't sound delicious!?

5/10/25, 12:44 PM - Eric Dixon: @⁨Chris Bro⁩ Judging by Erin's condition today I dont think we will make it down tomorrow. She's been sick since Wednesday and needs to be in a rainforest room constantly (humidifier on high). It's slightly better today, but whenever she stands up the coughs put her back down.
5/10/25, 12:46 PM - Mogey: Oh no Eric! What’s going on with her?
5/10/25, 12:47 PM - Modge Podge: So sorry to hear Erin is sick. 😭

There are definitely some bad coughing viruses going around right now 😷
5/10/25, 12:59 PM - Eric Dixon: Brett says potentially whooping cough or walking pneumonia, but her oxygen levels aren't too bad. Just needs to be in lots o humidity or else she coughs so hard it sounds like she's trying to cough up her toenail
5/10/25, 1:04 PM - Lori Alarcon: Yikes! Good energy for Erin’s recovery 🙏
5/10/25, 1:12 PM - Mogey: Oh man. Hopefully that starts to dissipate soon!
5/10/25, 2:08 PM - Corey Lowe: I hope you get well soon Erin!
5/10/25, 2:58 PM - Chris Bro: Sorry to hear Erin🙁. Hope you feel better soon.
5/10/25, 3:29 PM - Erin Wifey: Thanks guys! I'm ok, I just wouldn't want to spread this around. 
Correy I hope the liquid diet is going ok!

Dale was sick last week, but his health plan of Coke and hash browns fried in plenty of olive oil got him back in the saddle pretty quickly - so maybe not COVID... Or a short version???

9/9/25, 9:54 AM - Mase: Happy birthday to my favorite little brother
9/9/25, 10:33 AM - Mindy Montgomery-Dixon: Happy birthday Eric!!! 💐🎉🎁🎂
9/9/25, 11:12 AM - Mares Eatoats: No he’s mine!
9/9/25, 11:12 AM - Mase: I said it first, you had your chance
9/9/25, 11:39 AM - Eric Dixon: Chris, Lori thoughts on above...? (Morgan, I already know I'm your favorite)
9/9/25, 1:01 PM - Lori Alarcon: HB to my favorite little prophet , President Nelson!!🎉🎉🎂🎂
9/9/25, 1:30 PM - Corey Lowe: Eric, I’ll make an AI of you bro. Incoming later. Happy Birthday man!
9/9/25, 3:20 PM - Chris Bro: Happy birthday Eric! My thoughts on the above are that I think MaryAnn is right. You are hers. 
Regarding your birthday connection to the prophet , my favorite memory of you and President Nelson is when you were 11 and he came and spoke at the Rincon Stake Center. Afterwards, he invited anyone who wanted to come up and shake his hand.  You and I both did and he said that you were going to be a winner (my interpretation was that you would be a winner in life and that prophecy has clearly been fulfilled)
9/9/25, 4:15 PM - Eric Dixon: Thanks Chris, sometimes it's easy to feel like a weiner in life, but it's really the pronunciation that makes all the difference 😄

9/10/25, 5:45 AM - Mares Eatoats: Someone took this awesome picture of axel and thought I’d share
9/10/25, 10:05 AM - Corey Lowe: Which one is he?
9/10/25, 10:09 AM - Mindy Montgomery-Dixon: That's such a great action shot!   How fun!
9/10/25, 10:53 AM - Chris Bro: Impressive! He is dribbling with his eyes up so he can see the court and find the open man. Clearly his handles have surpassed the level of his mother. But can he shoot the rock like his mom?
9/10/25, 11:01 AM - Mares Eatoats: His stealing the ball skills are higher than his shooting skills
9/28/25, 2:28 AM - Mogey: https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/article/president-russell-m-nelson-memorial
9/28/25, 2:31 AM - Mogey: President Nelson’s teachings helped me draw closer to Christ than at any other point in my life. His talks helped me know that I could overcome  trials and struggles through the Savior and through continued learning and focusing on the gospel, temple attendance, and serving others. He will be greatly missed.
9/28/25, 2:31 AM - Mindy Montgomery-Dixon: I was just reading that!  😥
9/28/25, 2:32 AM - Corey Lowe: I think his most important messages lately have been to be a peacemaker, think Celestial, and let God prevail in your life! I’m so grateful for his love for everyone and his leadership as our Prophet.
9/29/25, 12:14 AM - Mase: Yes, President Nelson will be missed. He stopped in Snowflake many years ago before he was the prophet and said many things that still resonate with me today. Loved his words and the peaceful fervor that always accompanied him.
9/29/25, 1:00 AM - Modge Podge: I loved that he continually taught that we all can receive revelation in our lives for every aspect of our lives!
10/22/25, 4:29 AM - Mares Eatoats: Hi fam! I’m in AZ from Dec20 - jan 6(or something around that date). I can’t wait to see you all!
10/22/25, 9:50 AM - Chris Bro: Mom has some ideas for a family reunion during that time. Mom, maybe you can put your ideas and potential dates here in the chat and we can start making plans.
11/2/25, 6:19 PM - Modge Podge: Here in the mountains we'll be celebrating your Grandma's 92nd birthday in about an hour ish. If you have a minute to give her a call, she would love it! 😀

11/2/25, 9:12 PM - Mares Eatoats: What??
11/2/25, 10:59 PM - Lori Alarcon: Happy Birthday Grandma!!🎂❤️
11/3/25, 11:04 PM - Modge Podge: Sooo... Corey and Morgan are willing to host a 3-day/2-night family reunion at their house between the dates of Dec 30-Jan 4, depending on what works best for everyone. She is also checking to see if one of her friends has a nearby VRBO available.  What dates will work for everyone???❣️
11/4/25, 8:14 AM - Mogey: This is my friend’s home available in Estrella. It seems a little pricey? Like $435/night and must be rented a minimum of 4 days so it may not work but it’s an option nonetheless compared to a further away hotel for those that don’t want to cram into our home ;). 

Hey Morgan! On VRBO.com, their listing number is 406358.  
Let me know if it looks like it’ll work for you guys!

11/4/25, 5:10 PM - Chris Bro: Thank you Morgan and Corey for hosting! Given the cost of the VRBO (and other similar ones seem to be at least that price or much more expensive) it might make sense for families that dont want to cram in to your house to get a nearby hotel. Per my quick search, lots of reasonable ones available for around 130-140/ night.
11/4/25, 5:11 PM - Chris Bro: Also anyone interested in getting together for Thanksgiving? We are willing to host Thanksgiving 
We are also willing to travel.
11/4/25, 5:32 PM - Mogey: I found this one too. 375 a night. Split between a couple families is maybe not so bad and keeps you within Estrella 

Check out this place in Estrella Mountain Ranch I found on Vrbo. https://t.vrbo.io/xUTokIA31Xb
11/4/25, 5:34 PM - Mogey: We don’t have our kids for Thanksgiving and I think we’re joining Corey’s family that day
11/4/25, 6:41 PM - Erin Wifey: We could do two days and one night at Great Wolf Lodge for $342. Just saying 😜
11/4/25, 7:26 PM - Lori Alarcon: I talked to Jules and he thinks he should be off most of the dates in the range. He won’t know for sure until it gets closer due to some corporate changes in the company he works for. Go ahead and pick the dates that work best for everyone and we’ll do our best to join in🎉

11/13/25, 12:06 AM - Modge Podge: Family Reunion dates - Is everyone ok with Dec 31 - Jan 2??
11/13/25, 8:46 AM - Chris Bro: That works for us
11/13/25, 9:07 AM - Eric Dixon: I may need to work on the 2nd (and possibly the 31st) not totally sure yet
11/15/25, 3:07 PM - Chris Bro: Just following up on choosing dates for the reunion. We are available anytime from Dec. 24-Jan 4
11/15/25, 5:21 PM - Modge Podge: Eric said he can work remotely... so if he has to work all day, he would still be available after work for fun stuff. 😊
11/15/25, 6:44 PM - Chris Bro: So are we moving forward with Dec 31- Jan 2?
11/16/25, 1:11 AM - Mares Eatoats: Yes, let’s plan on Dec 31-Jan 2! 

Let’s start putting some ideas on the table! I just started thinking of random things to put on there. Add your ideas to the list below:

*Food Ideas*
1. Chinese food
2. ⁠pizza
3. ⁠eegees…. I’m sure we could figure out a way!
4. ⁠French toast bake
5. ⁠Lori’s spaghetti
6. ⁠Mindy’s croissants
7. ⁠

*Activity Ideas*
1. Not so baby anymore races 
2. ⁠croquet 
3. ⁠pickleball
4. ⁠can jam
5. ⁠games at the park
6.
11/16/25, 8:33 PM - Chris Bro: Sounds good. We have booked a nearby hotel for our family on those dates. . We are looking forward to it!
11/17/25, 1:15 PM - Modge Podge: I vote for a talent, performance, show and tell  night...sing, dance, Martial arts, painting, make up, lashes, braiding, AI, science, magic tricks, poetry - whatever we've got - let's enjoy  and celebrate it 😀!!!
11/17/25, 1:23 PM - Modge Podge: And of course - cooking! Bring or make your delicious specialty to share ❣️😋
11/18/25, 6:55 PM - Mogey: Eric, we can set up a workspace for you and we will make sure no one bothers you while you’re here!
11/18/25, 6:55 PM - Mogey: Looking forward to all the fun from New Year’s Eve to Jan 2!
11/18/25, 6:58 PM - Mares Eatoats: I’ll probably bother him
11/18/25, 8:12 PM - Eric Dixon: She will almost definitely
11/18/25, 8:23 PM - Mogey: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qKFHOQS4ZhWy_X0zIGMMxZ81oJI7FtMrKpz2ctsOA-M/edit?usp=sharing
11/18/25, 8:24 PM - Mogey: Rough draft of ideas for the reunion. Please add input, ideas, etc so we can bring it to fruition!
11/18/25, 8:40 PM - Mogey: Meal ideas are not set in stone. Just throwing out how it could work. 
If we all decide on home made meals rather than pizza and eegees, we will need to choose crockpot/ instapot/ grill type options for feeding the masses. I only have one large stove top burner that works so something like spaghetti is likely out.
11/18/25, 9:38 PM - Mindy Montgomery-Dixon: Erin makes a super yummy crockpot spaghetti!

I loved all of it!  We can definitely contribute.
11/19/25, 9:52 AM - Chris Bro: ! Feliz Cumpleaños Lori!

11/19/25, 10:15 AM - Eric Dixon: Which in case one of the Julian's arent nearby, that's Spanish for... Happy Birthday Lori!!!!
11/19/25, 11:45 AM - Chris Bro: Cortez could have translated it for her as well but thanks Eric for taking the time to look it up with AI and posting the translation
11/19/25, 2:35 PM - Mase: Happy birthday to my most favorite older sister!!!
11/19/25, 5:50 PM - Mares Eatoats: The words Lori understands in Spanish is el don gato
11/19/25, 5:50 PM - Mares Eatoats: Even then I don’t think she knows what she’s saying

11/26/25, 10:50 AM - Chris Bro: Congratulations Easton!
11/26/25, 10:51 AM - Chris Bro: Hermana Dixon would like handwritten cards and letters from family for Christmas on her mission. We want to stuff a large manilla envelope full of love. We need them by December 7. Andrea will be mailing it December 10 right after she collects any letters from family in the White Mountains. If you want us to get your letters in, please mail to us by December 1, or if you live in the White Mountains, Andrea will collect on December 10 when she comes up to stay with Erin and Eric’s kiddos.

12/29/25, 10:27 PM - Mogey: Eegees looks like it will be cheaper to order individual foot longs rather than party subs. 

I prefer turkey- grinder style subs. 

Does anyone else have preferences on their sandwich?

Do we want a party pack of slushies? A 25 person one is about $29. We can get up to 5 flavors. Any preferences there?

And include the holly berry for a flavor
